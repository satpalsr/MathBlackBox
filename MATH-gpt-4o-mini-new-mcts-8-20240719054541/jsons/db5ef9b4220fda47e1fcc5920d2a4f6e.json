Let's analyze the initial answer step by step, identify flaws and weaknesses, and propose corrections to improve clarity and correctness.\n\n1. **Finding the Roots**: \n   The solution begins by correctly identifying the roots of the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0 \\) using the quadratic formula.

It introduces \\( a^2 + b^2 \\) without sufficiently justifying the steps taken to arrive at that identity. A deeper exploration of identities or direct computation would help strengthen this part.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The answer comes to a conclusion but lacks a succinct summary that reiterates the calculations leading to the boxed solution.

However, it's crucial to clarify how to denote the roots. Calling them \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) without specifically stating which one is larger can lead to confusion. We should emphasize that \\( a = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\) is greater and \\( b = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\) is less than \\( 3/2 \\).\n\n2. **Understanding the Expression**:\n   - While the transformation to \\( \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{\\sqrt{ab}} \\) is mathematically correct, it should be explicitly stated why we're making this transformation. Each part of the expression should have a brief rationale so the reader understands the motivation behind each step.\n\n3. **Finding \\( ab \\)**:\n   - The explanation regarding Vieta's formulas was accurate but could be elaborated to affirm its relevance. While it's noted that \\( ab = 1 \\), a brief summary of why \\( ab = 1 \\) could strengthen the argument (i.e., \\( ab \\) comes from the constant term in the polynomial).\n\n4. **Calculating \\( a^2 + b^2 \\)**:\n   - The use of the identity \\( a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab \\) was correctly applied.

No flaws here, but it's important to emphasize the positive nature of both roots, which supports the context of the problem.\n\n### Step 2: Expressing the Desired Quantity\nThe expression to compute is:\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{b}} + \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{a}}.\n\\]\nThe solution gracefully transforms this into:\n\\[\n\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{\\sqrt{ab}}.\n\\]\n**Feedback**: \n- This transformation is a crucial and proper step, highlighting insight into simplifying the expression.

The use of the quadratic formula is appropriate, and the calculations correctly yield:\n\\[\na = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\quad b = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n\\]\n**Feedback**: \n- This section is accurate and well-explained. No flaws here, but it's important to emphasize the positive nature of both roots, which supports the context of the problem.\n\n### Step 2: Expressing the Desired Quantity\nThe expression to compute is:\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{b}} + \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{a}}.\n\\]\nThe solution gracefully transforms this into:\n\\[\n\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{\\sqrt{ab}}.\n\\]\n**Feedback**: \n- This transformation is a crucial and proper step, highlighting insight into simplifying the expression.
