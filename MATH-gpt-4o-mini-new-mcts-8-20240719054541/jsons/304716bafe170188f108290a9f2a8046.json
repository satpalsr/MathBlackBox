        "To critically analyze the provided answer, we'll go through each step of the reasoning process to identify flaws, clarify any misunderstandings, and ensure that the answer meets the requirements set in the problem. \n\n### Review of the Steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Projection Concept:**\n   - The definition and formula for the projection of one vector onto another are correctly stated. The calculation of the projection being zero relates directly to the dot product being zero, which is crucial for finding the plane.\n\n2. **Dot Product Calculation:**\n   - The computation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is accurate:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 10.\n     \\]\n   - The expression for \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is also correctly formulated:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x - 3z.\n     \\]\n   - Setting this dot product to zero is correctly derived. However, the subsequent expression could have been set more explicitly:\n     \\[\n     x - 3z = 0 \\implies x = 3z.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Forming the Plane Equation:**\n   - The derivation of the equation \\(x - 3z = 0\\) is correctly followed, leading to the correct representation in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the coefficients are identified as \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\). This is accurate.\n\n4. **Condition Checks:**\n   - The conditions \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\\) are verified correctly, yielding:\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the response satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem.\n\n### Feedback to Improve the Answer:\n1. **Clarity and Detail in Explanation:**\n   - While the steps are correct, the clarity can be improved. Explicitly stating that the dot product being zero indicates that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) lies in the plane orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would enhance understanding.\n   - Introducing the geometrical interpretation that vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that meet the criteria lie on a plane orthogonal to the direction of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would strengthen the explanation.\n\n2. **Explicit Final Format:**\n   - The final answer could be better formatted. Instead of concluding with a formal boxed answer twice, consolidating it to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{The equation of the plane is } x - 3z = 0 \\quad \\text{in the form } Ax + By + Cz + D = 0:\n     \\]\n     followed by the boxed final answer immediately.\n\n3. **Completeness:**\n   - Include a statement reflecting that \\(y\\) is free to take any value, emphasizing that the results are consistent with the realization of a plane.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the original answer is correct in terms of logic and calculation, enhancing clarity, depth in explanation, and presentation would improve the overall quality. Highlighting the plane's nature connected to the vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and subtly emphasizing geometric interpretation alongside algebra would provide a more complete response.\n\n### Revised Final Answer:\nAfter considering the feedback, the improved final answer can be summarized as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The equation of the plane is } x - 3z = 0 \\text{ or } 1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n\\]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{x - 3z = 0} \\n#### x - 3z = 0\\).",
        "Certainly! Let’s analyze the previous answer provided step by step, addressing any imperfections or areas that require clarification or improvement. \n\n### 1. Correctness of the Concept:\n- The answer correctly identifies the fundamental requirement that the projection \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) implies \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\). This is a critical point and forms the basis of finding the equation of the plane. \n\n### 2. Calculation of Projection:\n- The projection calculation was not explicitly shown in the completed response, which is acceptable since the key point derived from it (\\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\)) was correctly utilized.\n- However, it would improve clarity to explicitly state that \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0\\) is the condition for orthogonality.\n\n### 3. Setting Up the Dot Product:\n- The response correctly assigns \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\\) and calculates \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) as \\(x - 3z = 0\\).\n- The resulting equation is \\(x = 3z\\). This step is clearly stated and derives the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) effectively.\n\n### 4. Formulating the Plane Equation:\n- The transition to the plane equation \\(x - 3z = 0\\) translates well into the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) as \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0\\).\n- However, this was not presented with sufficient clarity. It is important to state that this format fits the required \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) and to explicitly identify the coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) after this transformation.\n\n### 5. Verification of Conditions:\n- The answer provides the coefficient values correctly: \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\).\n- It also correctly checks the condition \\(A > 0\\) and shows \\(\\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1\\), which fulfills the requirements.\n  \n### 6. Final Presentation:\n- The final boxed answer is right; however, the presentation could be improved by clearly stating that the final equation of the plane is \\(x - 3z = 0\\).\n- Overall, the answer would benefit from clearer organization and articulation, particularly in justifying each transformation step and explaining what each transformation means regarding the problem at hand.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- Ensure clarity in each step by being explicit about the underlying reasonings. \n- Clearly distinguish between steps and maintain a logical flow, making connections between concepts more explicit.\n- Include all calculations and transformations in a way that reinforces understanding.\n  \n### Suggested Revised Answer:\nTo effectively communicate this solution, a revised answer would begin with clearly defined steps, addressing the above critique while ensuring thoroughness and clarity throughout the reasoning process.\n\n### Revised Answer:\nLet's synthesize these points into a final structured answer:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nThe projection of vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is given by \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v}\\). Setting this to zero implies that \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\) since \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}}{\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{w}\\).\n\n### Step 1: Define Vectors\nLet \\(\\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Dot Product\nCalculating the dot product gives us:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x \\cdot 1 + y \\cdot 0 + z \\cdot (-3) = x - 3z.\n\\]\nSetting this equal to zero gives:\n\\[\nx - 3z = 0 \\implies x = 3z.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert to Plane Equation\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\nx - 3z = 0,\n\\]\nwhich can be expressed in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) as:\n\\[\n1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n\\]\n\n### [Verification]\nIdentifying the coefficients yields \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), and \\(D = 0\\). We check that \\(A > 0\\) and confirm \\(\\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1\\), satisfying the required conditions.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the equation of the plane is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{x - 3z = 0} \\n#### x - 3z = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis structured approach ensures clarity and demonstrates a rigorous application of mathematical reasoning.",
        "Certainly! Let's analyze the original response critically, identifying potential weaknesses and areas for improvement. We will break down the necessary components step by step and highlight where the answer could be enhanced.\n\n### Breakdown and Critique\n\n1. **Understanding Projection and Orthogonality**:\n   - The answer correctly identifies that the condition \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) implies that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). This is a fundamental point and is well stated.\n\n2. **Dot Product Calculation**:\n   - The response accurately computes the dot product \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) to find the equation \\(x - 3z = 0\\). However, a more detailed explanation of the calculation steps can improve clarity for readers who may not immediately follow the computation.\n\n3. **Plane Equation Formulation**:\n   - The conversion from \\(x - 3z = 0\\) to the standard form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) is done correctly, but the explanation could have benefited from explicitly stating the reasoning behind rearranging the equation. It might confuse a reader if they do not see the transition clearly.\n\n4. **Validating Conditions**:\n   - The verification of the conditions \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\\) is addressed, but the explanation could be clearer. For instance, the explanation assumes the reader understands what \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) refer to without explicitly restating them when verifying the GCD condition.\n\n5. **Final Presentation and Formatting**:\n   - The presentation of the final answer, while technically correct, uses the box notation slightly awkwardly. It could be streamlined to emphasize the conclusion more clearly. The term \"\\n####\" might confuse readers as it does not contribute to mathematical clarity.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Provide a More Comprehensive Explanation**:\n   - Include step-by-step calculations and reasoning behind each transformation of equations. This would help those unfamiliar with vector projections and plane equations follow the logic more easily.\n  \n2. **Explicit Verification Steps**:\n   - Clearly state the values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) when discussing the GCD condition.\n\n3. **Clearer Conclusion Formatting**:\n   - Format the final answer in a clean and readable manner, removing any unnecessary coding or symbols that don’t pertain to the math.\n\n### Revised Answer\n\nTo clarify the reasoning and to incorporate the suggested improvements, here’s an example of a better-structured response:\n\n---\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nThe projection of a vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto another vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) being zero means that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). In mathematical terms, this is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}}{\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{0}.\n\\]\nThis condition is satisfied when \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\).\n\nGiven \\(\\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and letting \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\\), we can compute:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x \\cdot 1 + y \\cdot 0 + z \\cdot (-3) = x - 3z.\n\\]\nSetting this equal to zero gives the equation of the plane:\n\\[\nx - 3z = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Plane Equation\nWe can rewrite this equation in the standard form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\):\n\\[\nx + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n\\]\nFrom this, we identify the coefficients: \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), and \\(D = 0\\).\n\n### [Verification]\nNow we check the necessary conditions:\n1. **Condition \\(A > 0\\)**: Here, \\(A = 1\\), which fulfills \\(A > 0\\).\n2. **GCD Condition**: We compute \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = \\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1\\), satisfying the requirement that the greatest common divisor equals 1.\n\n### [Final Answer]\nThus, the equation of the plane is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{x - 3z = 0}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThis revised answer improves clarity and rigor, ensuring that each step is justified and easy to follow.",
        "Certainly! Let's conduct a detailed analysis of the previous answer step by step, identifying potential flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem Statement\n\nThe statement asks for the set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) such that the projection of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) equals the zero vector. This implies that the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) must be orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). Thus, we need a precise understanding of when \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\).\n\n**Flaw:** The interpretation is correct, but the reasoning could be clarified more explicitly. The statement should strongly emphasize that \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) when \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Dot Product Condition\n\nTo find when \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\), we had:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0.\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(\\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\):\n\nThe dot product yields:\n\n\\[\nx \\cdot 1 + y \\cdot 0 + z \\cdot (-3) = x - 3z = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis simplification is accurate.\n\n**Flaw:** The answer could have included that this generates the equation of the plane directly, emphasizing that all vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) satisfying this dot product lie in that plane.\n\n### Step 3: Rearranging to Plane Equation\n\nWe derived:\n\n\\[\nx - 3z = 0 \\implies x = 3z.\n\\]\n\nThis establishes a relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(z\\); however, it could be stated that \\(y\\) is free to take any value, thus defining a plane in 3D space.\n\n**Flaw:** The explanation could clarify how this represents a plane with respect to the three-dimensional coordinate system.\n\n### Step 4: Rewrite the Equation\n\nThe equation can be rewritten in standard form:\n\n\\[\nx + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis leads to the coefficients:\n\n- \\(A = 1\\)\n- \\(B = 0\\)\n- \\(C = -3\\)\n- \\(D = 0\\)\n\n**Flaw:** It is good to explicitly mention the relationship of these coefficients to establishing the standard form of the plane equation.\n\n### Step 5: GCD and Condition Check\n\nI stated:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1,\n\\]\n\nand confirmed that \\(A > 0\\). This analysis is accurate.\n\n### Conclusion and Overall Feedback\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. Methodically derived the condition for orthogonality.\n2. Correctly derived the equation corresponding to the plane in a clear mathematical manner.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. The reasoning lacked a clear, structured connection to a geometrical interpretation of the plane.\n2. The presentation could have been more explicit about each step in terms of what it signifies geometrically (plane dimensions, free variables, etc.).\n3. Missed emphasizing that \\(y\\) can take any value, making the equation a plane (flat surface) rather than a line.\n\nIn conclusion, while the core calculation was accurate, enhancing the clarity and depth of explanation would significantly improve the answer. \n\n### Final Refined Answer\n\nTo reaffirm the accuracy after evaluating the feedback:\n\nThe equation of the plane formed by vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that satisfy \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) is indeed:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x - 3z = 0} \\n#### x - 3z = 0.\n\\] \n\nThis equation appropriately describes a plane in three-dimensional space, where \\(y\\) can vary freely.",

        "Let's analyze the provided answer carefully, step by step, and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to find the equation of a plane where the projection of a vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is zero. The provided solution correctly identifies that for this projection to be zero, we require \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\). This is an appropriate understanding of the problem.\n\n2. **Calculating the Dot Product**: The equation obtained from the dot product, \\(x - 3z = 0\\), is correctly derived. However, it's important to explicitly state where the components of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) (represented as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\\)) come from to avoid ambiguity. This ensures that the reader knows exactly how \\(x, y,\\) and \\(z\\) relate to the variables in the expression.\n\n3. **Rearranging the Equation**: The form provided, \\(x - 3z = 0\\), is a linear equation.

Mentioning that \\(A, B, C,\\) and \\(D\\) are integers and confirming that they are pairwise coprime would strengthen this point.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**: The answer is presented in a boxed format, which is helpful for clarity.

        "Let's analyze the previous response step by step, pointing out any flaws and areas where clarity could be improved.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n**Flaw:** The initial explanation regarding the projection formula is mostly accurate, but it could be made clearer to specify why \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) necessitates \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\). Emphasizing that this is due to the fact that if the projection is zero, the vector must be orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would help in understanding.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Dot Product\n**Flaw:** The computation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is correct, but the response does not explicitly link this to the condition for \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) being orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\). While it gets to the right dot product, the transition could be smoother, pointing out the connection to orthogonality clearly.\n\n### Step 3: Setting up the Equation\n**Flaw:** The response provides the simplified form as \\(x - 3z = 0\\) but does not appropriately discuss how this relates back to the required format of \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\). It's important to clearly highlight how the equation is transformed into the standard form, ensuring the reader follows through.\n\n### Step 4: Coefficient Conditions\n**Flaw:** The final part about checking \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\\) is present but could be better illustrated. Although it does correctly identify that \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), and \\(D = 0\\), illustrating how \\(|B|\\) and \\(|D|\\) don't affect the gcd would make the explanation more complete.\n\n### Final Answer Formatting\n**Flaw:** The formatting of the final answer could lead to confusion. It's presented in a way that might suggest two different answers are being provided. Clarifying that the boxed answer should just be the equation of the plane would enhance clarity.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\n- **Clarity and Structure:** Maintain clearer links between definitions, formulas, and final derivations. Each logical step should build on the previous one without assumptive jumps.\n- **Detailed Justifications:** Make sure every conclusion is motivated by a thorough explanation of underlying principles, especially regarding vector operations.\n- **Consistency in Final Presentation:** Ensure that the final answer is unambiguous. Only present it in the needed format once and clarify that it is indeed the answer to the posed question.\n\n### Revised Final Answer:\nTaking into account all the feedback and corrections, the final answer could be presented as follows:\n\nTo find the plane defined by \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\), this implies:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0 \\Rightarrow x - 3z = 0 \\Rightarrow x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation of the plane is \n\n\\[\n1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich is already in the desired form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) with \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\).\n\n\\(\\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1\\) confirms that the conditions are satisfied.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } \\boxed{x - 3z = 0} \\n#### x - 3z = 0\n\\] \n\nThis response directly addresses the original requirements while also applying the feedback to provide a more complete and understandable answer.",

It’s important to clarify that this form should capture all variables involved clearly.\n\n### Step 4: Formulating the Plane Equation\nThe solution attempts to write this as:\n\n\\[\nx + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich is transformed into:\n\n\\[\nx - 3z = 0.\n\\]\n\n#### Critique:\n- The transformation is valid, but it lacks clarity in expressing it in the required form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\).

Lack of clarity in presenting the final form required by the problem.\n2. Absence of a statement emphasizing that this equation describes a plane where \\(y\\) is free.\n3.

        "Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas that could be improved. We'll break it down into logical components to ensure clarity and thoroughness.\n\n### Breakdown of the Original Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - The problem states that \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\), meaning the projection of vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) must be the zero vector.\n   - The solution correctly interprets this condition as requiring the dot product \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\).\n\n2. **Calculation of the Dot Product**:\n   - The calculation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is unnecessary since the question requires only the dot product \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\). While this part is correct, it introduces a bit of extra information that isn't needed to understand the relationship.\n\n3. **Setting up the Equation**:\n   - The dot product was calculated as \\(v_1 - 3v_3 = 0\\), leading to \\(v_1 = 3v_3\\). This is accurate and demonstrates the relationship needed for vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) to lie in the desired plane. However, a bit more clarity could have been provided regarding the form of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) in terms of free variables.\n\n4. **Finding the Plane Equation**:\n   - The transformation to the plane equation \\(v_1 - 3v_3 = 0\\) was stated, but the connection to the standard form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) could have been presented more explicitly. The conversion step could have been elaborated to avoid confusion.\n\n5. **Identification of Coefficients**:\n   - The coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) were identified correctly. However, the final equation of the plane was written as \\(x - 3z = 0\\), which lacks \\(B\\) since \\(v_2\\) was ignored in the final representation of the plane equation. A complete expression should include all variables, reinforcing that \\(v_2\\) can take any value.\n\n6. **Checking Conditions**:\n   - The conditions \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\\) were checked, which were found to be satisfied. However, since we should also include \\(B\\) in the equation, the verification needs to reflect that. If \\(B = 0\\), then we should clearly indicate that this forms part of the condition for the plane.\n\n### Summary of Improvements Needed\n\n- **Clarity and Structure**: The explanation could benefit from more structured formatting and explicit connections between steps. Each transformational step should be clearly articulated.\n  \n- **Complete Representation of the Variables**: The final equation should include all variables \\(v_1\\), \\(v_2\\), and \\(v_3\\) in the plane equation format. The inclusion of \\(B\\) in the equation is essential for completeness and correctness.\n\n- **Verification Step Needs Enhancements**: Include a more robust verification process to ensure all values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are represented and checked appropriately.\n\n### Revised Answer\n\nTo correct these issues, the equation of the plane where \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) lies could be presented as follows:\n\nWe start with the condition \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\), which leads to:\n\n\\[\nv_1 - 3v_3 = 0 \\implies v_1 = 3v_3.\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that every vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) can be represented as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3v_3 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(v_2\\) is arbitrary. The equation of the plane can therefore be expressed in the form:\n\n\\[\nv_1 - 3v_3 + 0v_2 = 0 \\implies A = 1, B = 0, C = -3, D = 0.\n\\]\n\nFinally, the equation of the plane is:\n\n\\[\n1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0 \\implies x - 3z = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Final Correct Structural Answer\n\nThus, ensuring all conditions are satisfied, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x - 3z = 0} \\n#### x - 3z = 0.\n\\] \n\nThis keeps \\(v_2\\) free and emphasizes correct variable representation while adhering to the required form.",

This means that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) must be orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\).\n\n2. **Calculating the Projection**:\n   - The formula used for the projection is correct:\n     \\[\n     \\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}}{\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{w}.\n     \\]\n   - The calculation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 10\\) is also correct.\n\n3. **Setting the Dot Product to Zero**:\n   - The computation of the dot product \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x - 3z\\) is accurate, leading to \\(x - 3z = 0\\).\n\n4. **Expressing in Plane Equation Form**:\n   - The rearrangement to find the equation of the plane was done appropriately.

Each step, especially the transition from the projection to the plane equation, should include a bit more reasoning. For example, explicitly stating that the plane is defined by vectors orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) could enhance clarity.\n\n2. **Formatting of the Final Answer**:\n   - The way the final answer is presented could be confusing. Stating \\(\\boxed{x - 3z = 0}\\) alongside another boxed representation could imply an additional answer format that may not be necessary. Instead, use only one format clearly for presentation.\n\n3. **Use of Mathematical Notation**: While the mathematical notation was used appropriately, ensuring consistent formatting throughout (e.g., ensuring all vectors or matrices are formatted similarly) would enhance readability.\n\n4. **Verification**: While stating that the verification was quick (e.g., checking conditions), including a brief verification process directly would help reinforce understanding, especially for those who may not be as familiar with the concepts of projection or vector orthogonality.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOverall, the answer captures the essential mathematical steps correctly while covering the key aspects needed to find the plane equation. The main areas for improvement involve clarity in the explanatory details and the final presentation consistency. \n\nBy following these suggestions, the response could be made stronger and provide a clearer understanding of the concept being discussed.",

        "To analyze the previous response step by step, let's look at its components critically and identify any flaws or areas that could be improved:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**:\n   - The problem requires finding vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) where the projection onto \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) equals \\(\\mathbf{0}\\).\n   - It states that this set of vectors lies on a plane, which is indeed correct.\n\n2. **Projection Calculation**:\n   - The calculation of the projection itself is correct:\n     \\[\n     \\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}}{\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{w}\n     \\]\n   - However, it should make it clearer that \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) leads to the condition \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\).\n\n3. **Dot Product Expression**:\n   - The dot product calculation was presented correctly:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x - 3z\n     \\]\n\n4. **Setting the Dot Product to Zero**:\n   - The equation derived from setting the dot product to zero, \\(x - 3z = 0\\), is correct. This simplifies to \\(x = 3z\\).\n\n5. **Presenting the Plane Equation**:\n   - The response correctly reformulates the equation into the standard plane form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\).\n   - The equation stated in the final answer was rewritten correctly as \\(x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0\\).\n\n6. **Coefficients Identification**:\n   - The coefficients were identified correctly:\n     - \\(A = 1\\)\n     - \\(B = 0\\)\n     - \\(C = -3\\)\n     - \\(D = 0\\)\n\n7. **Condition Checks**:\n   - The criteria \\(A > 0\\) was verified correctly, as \\(A = 1\\).\n   - Checking the GCD condition \\(\\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1\\) was also accurate.\n\n8. **Final Answer Presentation**:\n   - The form of the final answer was confused in format. Instead of saying \"The answer is \\(\\boxed{x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0}\\)\", it should have been presented as:\n     \\[\n     Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\n     \\]\n     or similar in clearer terms.\n\n**Overall Flaws and Improvements**:\n- **Clarity and Precision**: The explanation should emphasize what each part of the calculation leads to without assuming the reader can always follow implicit reasoning.\n- **Correctness in Formatting**: The final answer should be formatted to showcase the equation properly and highlight \\(A, B, C, D\\).\n- **Expounding the GCD Check**: Perhaps clarify that the conditions for \\(A, B, C, D\\) ensure the equation is correctly expressed in the simplest form.\n\nIn conclusion, the response largely contains the correct mathematical reasoning, but could benefit from improved clarity, refined presentation, and a more straightforward format when listing final equations. \n\nRevised presentation with corrections:\n\n[Final Answer] The equation of the plane where \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) is given by:\n\\[\n1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0\n\\] \nThus, the final answer is  \n\\(\\boxed{x - 3z = 0}\\)  \n#### \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0\\)",
        "To provide you with a thorough critique of your previous answer regarding the projection of vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and finding the corresponding plane, let’s closely analyze each component of your response.\n\n### Breakdown of the Answer\n\n1. **Projection Formula**:\n   - You correctly identified the projection formula:\n     \\[\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}}{\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{w}.\\]\n   - Here, it's crucial to specify that for the projection to be \\(\\mathbf{0}\\), the numerator must be zero (i.e., \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\)), which you did adequately.\n\n2. **Dot Product Calculation**:\n   - You computed the dot product correctly:\n     \\[\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x - 3z.\\]\n   - Defining this correctly leads to the condition \\(x - 3z = 0\\), which you also stated accurately.\n\n3. **Plane Description**:\n   - You stated that the plane can be described by the condition \\(x = 3z\\). However, it was less explicit in showing how this corresponds to a standard plane equation in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).\n\n4. **Standard Form Equation**:\n   - While you arrived at \\(x - 3z = 0\\), you then needed to express this in the required form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) clearly. You did recognize that this can be expressed as \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0\\), which is correct.\n   - However, clarity in transitioning from \\(x = 3z\\) to the standard form could have been improved. Clearly stating the transition from one to the other would enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Conditions Check**:\n   - You verified \\(A > 0\\) appropriately, stating that \\(A = 1\\) satisfies this condition.\n   - You also correctly calculated \\(\\gcd(|1|, |0|, |-3|, |0|)\\) to confirm it equals 1. This step is important, and you executed it correctly.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity in Explanation**: \n   - While the logic was generally correct, it could have been more readable by breaking down the transition to the plane equation with more explicit steps.\n\n2. **Comprehensiveness**:\n   - It would have been helpful to explain why the orthogonality condition leads to a plane, perhaps by mentioning that all vectors orthogonal to a given vector lie in a hyperplane (or plane in 3D space).\n\n3. **Formality and Structure**:\n   - The answer could have benefited from a more formal structure with a clearer distinction between reasoning, calculation, and final answer presentation.\n\n4. **Formatting of Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer should be represented clearly, focusing solely on the result rather than bundling it with explanations. The notation should be precise and standardized.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYour response was on the right track, demonstrating a solid understanding of the problem, but a few enhancements in clarity, structure, and completeness would significantly improve the presentation. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0}\\)  \n#### \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0\\) \n\nThese critical observations can help refine your writing and problem-solving process for future mathematical inquiries. Remember that clarity and structure in your explanations are just as vital as correctness in calculations."

            "To critically analyze the provided answer, we'll go through each step of the reasoning process to identify flaws, clarify any misunderstandings, and ensure that the answer meets the requirements set in the problem. \n\n### Review of the Steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Projection Concept:**\n   - The definition and formula for the projection of one vector onto another are correctly stated. The calculation of the projection being zero relates directly to the dot product being zero, which is crucial for finding the plane.\n\n2. **Dot Product Calculation:**\n   - The computation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is accurate:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 10.\n     \\]\n   - The expression for \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is also correctly formulated:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x - 3z.\n     \\]\n   - Setting this dot product to zero is correctly derived.

Explicitly stating that the dot product being zero indicates that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) lies in the plane orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would enhance understanding.\n   - Introducing the geometrical interpretation that vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that meet the criteria lie on a plane orthogonal to the direction of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would strengthen the explanation.\n\n2. **Explicit Final Format:**\n   - The final answer could be better formatted.

            "Let's analyze the provided answer carefully, step by step, and identify any flaws or areas for improvement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to find the equation of a plane where the projection of a vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) is zero. The provided solution correctly identifies that for this projection to be zero, we require \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\). This is an appropriate understanding of the problem.\n\n2. **Calculating the Dot Product**: The equation obtained from the dot product, \\(x - 3z = 0\\), is correctly derived. However, it's important to explicitly state where the components of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) (represented as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\\)) come from to avoid ambiguity. This ensures that the reader knows exactly how \\(x, y,\\) and \\(z\\) relate to the variables in the expression.\n\n3. **Rearranging the Equation**: The form provided, \\(x - 3z = 0\\), is a linear equation. However, to align with the required format \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\), the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n   \\[\n   1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n   \\]\n\n   This is consistent with the form requested by the problem. Notably, transitioning directly to \\(Ax + By + Cz + D\\) format could have been clearer.\n\n4. **Conditions on Coefficients**: The response correctly identifies the coefficients as \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), and \\(D = 0\\), and it checks the condition \\(A > 0\\), which holds true. However, a more explicit check could have been provided for the greatest common divisor condition. The response states:\n\n   \\[\n   \\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1,\n   \\]\n\n   Although this is correct, it could have been clearer. Mentioning that \\(A, B, C,\\) and \\(D\\) are integers and confirming that they are pairwise coprime would strengthen this point.\n\n5. **Final Answer Presentation**: The answer is presented in a boxed format, which is helpful for clarity. However, the text repeats the expression \\(x - 3z = 0\\) outside the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\), which can be misleading. It'd be better to keep the final answer format consistent. State that it's the equation of the plane and follow it with the boxed form only once.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe response correctly derived the equation of the plane, but it lacked clarity in explaining certain steps, particularly in expressing the transition from the vector representation to the required equation format.

We confirm that \\(A > 0\\) and check the gcd:\n\n\\[\n\\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1.\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation of the plane is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0}.\n\\]\n\nThis can also be expressed simply as:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x - 3z = 0}.\n\\]\n```\n\nThis format avoids repetition and presents the key steps more clearly.",

It's presented in a way that might suggest two different answers are being provided. Clarifying that the boxed answer should just be the equation of the plane would enhance clarity.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\n- **Clarity and Structure:** Maintain clearer links between definitions, formulas, and final derivations. Each logical step should build on the previous one without assumptive jumps.\n- **Detailed Justifications:** Make sure every conclusion is motivated by a thorough explanation of underlying principles, especially regarding vector operations.\n- **Consistency in Final Presentation:** Ensure that the final answer is unambiguous.

Correctness of the Concept:\n- The answer correctly identifies the fundamental requirement that the projection \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) implies \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\). This is a critical point and forms the basis of finding the equation of the plane. \n\n### 2. Calculation of Projection:\n- The projection calculation was not explicitly shown in the completed response, which is acceptable since the key point derived from it (\\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\)) was correctly utilized.\n- However, it would improve clarity to explicitly state that \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0\\) is the condition for orthogonality.\n\n### 3.

Verification of Conditions:\n- The answer provides the coefficient values correctly: \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\).\n- It also correctly checks the condition \\(A > 0\\) and shows \\(\\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1\\), which fulfills the requirements.\n  \n### 6.

The conversion step could have been elaborated to avoid confusion.\n\n5. **Identification of Coefficients**:\n   - The coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) were identified correctly. However, the final equation of the plane was written as \\(x - 3z = 0\\), which lacks \\(B\\) since \\(v_2\\) was ignored in the final representation of the plane equation.

However, it was less explicit in showing how this corresponds to a standard plane equation in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).\n\n4. **Standard Form Equation**:\n   - While you arrived at \\(x - 3z = 0\\), you then needed to express this in the required form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) clearly. You did recognize that this can be expressed as \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0\\), which is correct.\n   - However, clarity in transitioning from \\(x = 3z\\) to the standard form could have been improved. Clearly stating the transition from one to the other would enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Conditions Check**:\n   - You verified \\(A > 0\\) appropriately, stating that \\(A = 1\\) satisfies this condition.\n   - You also correctly calculated \\(\\gcd(|1|, |0|, |-3|, |0|)\\) to confirm it equals 1. This step is important, and you executed it correctly.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity in Explanation**: \n   - While the logic was generally correct, it could have been more readable by breaking down the transition to the plane equation with more explicit steps.\n\n2. **Comprehensiveness**:\n   - It would have been helpful to explain why the orthogonality condition leads to a plane, perhaps by mentioning that all vectors orthogonal to a given vector lie in a hyperplane (or plane in 3D space).\n\n3. **Formality and Structure**:\n   - The answer could have benefited from a more formal structure with a clearer distinction between reasoning, calculation, and final answer presentation.\n\n4. **Formatting of Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer should be represented clearly, focusing solely on the result rather than bundling it with explanations. The notation should be precise and standardized.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYour response was on the right track, demonstrating a solid understanding of the problem, but a few enhancements in clarity, structure, and completeness would significantly improve the presentation. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0}\\)  \n#### \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0\\) \n\nThese critical observations can help refine your writing and problem-solving process for future mathematical inquiries. Remember that clarity and structure in your explanations are just as vital as correctness in calculations."

The calculation of the projection being zero relates directly to the dot product being zero, which is crucial for finding the plane.\n\n2. **Dot Product Calculation:**\n   - The computation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is accurate:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 10.\n     \\]\n   - The expression for \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is also correctly formulated:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x - 3z.\n     \\]\n   - Setting this dot product to zero is correctly derived. However, the subsequent expression could have been set more explicitly:\n     \\[\n     x - 3z = 0 \\implies x = 3z.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Forming the Plane Equation:**\n   - The derivation of the equation \\(x - 3z = 0\\) is correctly followed, leading to the correct representation in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the coefficients are identified as \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\). This is accurate.\n\n4. **Condition Checks:**\n   - The conditions \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\\) are verified correctly, yielding:\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the response satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem.\n\n### Feedback to Improve the Answer:\n1. **Clarity and Detail in Explanation:**\n   - While the steps are correct, the clarity can be improved. Explicitly stating that the dot product being zero indicates that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) lies in the plane orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would enhance understanding.\n   - Introducing the geometrical interpretation that vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that meet the criteria lie on a plane orthogonal to the direction of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would strengthen the explanation.\n\n2. **Explicit Final Format:**\n   - The final answer could be better formatted. Instead of concluding with a formal boxed answer twice, consolidating it to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{The equation of the plane is } x - 3z = 0 \\quad \\text{in the form } Ax + By + Cz + D = 0:\n     \\]\n     followed by the boxed final answer immediately.\n\n3. **Completeness:**\n   - Include a statement reflecting that \\(y\\) is free to take any value, emphasizing that the results are consistent with the realization of a plane.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the original answer is correct in terms of logic and calculation, enhancing clarity, depth in explanation, and presentation would improve the overall quality. Highlighting the plane's nature connected to the vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and subtly emphasizing geometric interpretation alongside algebra would provide a more complete response.\n\n### Revised Final Answer:\nAfter considering the feedback, the improved final answer can be summarized as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The equation of the plane is } x - 3z = 0 \\text{ or } 1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n\\]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{x - 3z = 0} \\n#### x - 3z = 0\\).",

            "To critically analyze the provided answer, we'll go through each step of the reasoning process to identify flaws, clarify any misunderstandings, and ensure that the answer meets the requirements set in the problem. \n\n### Review of the Steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Projection Concept:**\n   - The definition and formula for the projection of one vector onto another are correctly stated. The calculation of the projection being zero relates directly to the dot product being zero, which is crucial for finding the plane.\n\n2. **Dot Product Calculation:**\n   - The computation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is accurate:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 10.\n     \\]\n   - The expression for \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is also correctly formulated:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x - 3z.\n     \\]\n   - Setting this dot product to zero is correctly derived. However, the subsequent expression could have been set more explicitly:\n     \\[\n     x - 3z = 0 \\implies x = 3z.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Forming the Plane Equation:**\n   - The derivation of the equation \\(x - 3z = 0\\) is correctly followed, leading to the correct representation in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the coefficients are identified as \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\). This is accurate.\n\n4. **Condition Checks:**\n   - The conditions \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\\) are verified correctly, yielding:\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the response satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem.\n\n### Feedback to Improve the Answer:\n1. **Clarity and Detail in Explanation:**\n   - While the steps are correct, the clarity can be improved. Explicitly stating that the dot product being zero indicates that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) lies in the plane orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would enhance understanding.\n   - Introducing the geometrical interpretation that vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that meet the criteria lie on a plane orthogonal to the direction of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would strengthen the explanation.\n\n2. **Explicit Final Format:**\n   - The final answer could be better formatted. Instead of concluding with a formal boxed answer twice, consolidating it to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{The equation of the plane is } x - 3z = 0 \\quad \\text{in the form } Ax + By + Cz + D = 0:\n     \\]\n     followed by the boxed final answer immediately.\n\n3. **Completeness:**\n   - Include a statement reflecting that \\(y\\) is free to take any value, emphasizing that the results are consistent with the realization of a plane.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the original answer is correct in terms of logic and calculation, enhancing clarity, depth in explanation, and presentation would improve the overall quality. Highlighting the plane's nature connected to the vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and subtly emphasizing geometric interpretation alongside algebra would provide a more complete response.\n\n### Revised Final Answer:\nAfter considering the feedback, the improved final answer can be summarized as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The equation of the plane is } x - 3z = 0 \\text{ or } 1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n\\]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{x - 3z = 0} \\n#### x - 3z = 0\\).",

            "Certainly! Let’s analyze the previous answer provided step by step, addressing any imperfections or areas that require clarification or improvement. \n\n### 1. Correctness of the Concept:\n- The answer correctly identifies the fundamental requirement that the projection \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) implies \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\). This is a critical point and forms the basis of finding the equation of the plane. \n\n### 2. Calculation of Projection:\n- The projection calculation was not explicitly shown in the completed response, which is acceptable since the key point derived from it (\\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\)) was correctly utilized.\n- However, it would improve clarity to explicitly state that \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0\\) is the condition for orthogonality.\n\n### 3. Setting Up the Dot Product:\n- The response correctly assigns \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\\) and calculates \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) as \\(x - 3z = 0\\).\n- The resulting equation is \\(x = 3z\\). This step is clearly stated and derives the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) effectively.\n\n### 4. Formulating the Plane Equation:\n- The transition to the plane equation \\(x - 3z = 0\\) translates well into the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) as \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0\\).\n- However, this was not presented with sufficient clarity. It is important to state that this format fits the required \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) and to explicitly identify the coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) after this transformation.\n\n### 5. Verification of Conditions:\n- The answer provides the coefficient values correctly: \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\).\n- It also correctly checks the condition \\(A > 0\\) and shows \\(\\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1\\), which fulfills the requirements.\n  \n### 6. Final Presentation:\n- The final boxed answer is right; however, the presentation could be improved by clearly stating that the final equation of the plane is \\(x - 3z = 0\\).\n- Overall, the answer would benefit from clearer organization and articulation, particularly in justifying each transformation step and explaining what each transformation means regarding the problem at hand.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- Ensure clarity in each step by being explicit about the underlying reasonings. \n- Clearly distinguish between steps and maintain a logical flow, making connections between concepts more explicit.\n- Include all calculations and transformations in a way that reinforces understanding.\n  \n### Suggested Revised Answer:\nTo effectively communicate this solution, a revised answer would begin with clearly defined steps, addressing the above critique while ensuring thoroughness and clarity throughout the reasoning process.\n\n### Revised Answer:\nLet's synthesize these points into a final structured answer:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nThe projection of vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is given by \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v}\\).

            "To critically analyze the provided answer, we'll go through each step of the reasoning process to identify flaws, clarify any misunderstandings, and ensure that the answer meets the requirements set in the problem. \n\n### Review of the Steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Projection Concept:**\n   - The definition and formula for the projection of one vector onto another are correctly stated. The calculation of the projection being zero relates directly to the dot product being zero, which is crucial for finding the plane.\n\n2. **Dot Product Calculation:**\n   - The computation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is accurate:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 10.\n     \\]\n   - The expression for \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is also correctly formulated:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x - 3z.\n     \\]\n   - Setting this dot product to zero is correctly derived. However, the subsequent expression could have been set more explicitly:\n     \\[\n     x - 3z = 0 \\implies x = 3z.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Forming the Plane Equation:**\n   - The derivation of the equation \\(x - 3z = 0\\) is correctly followed, leading to the correct representation in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the coefficients are identified as \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\). This is accurate.\n\n4. **Condition Checks:**\n   - The conditions \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\\) are verified correctly, yielding:\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the response satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem.\n\n### Feedback to Improve the Answer:\n1. **Clarity and Detail in Explanation:**\n   - While the steps are correct, the clarity can be improved. Explicitly stating that the dot product being zero indicates that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) lies in the plane orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would enhance understanding.\n   - Introducing the geometrical interpretation that vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that meet the criteria lie on a plane orthogonal to the direction of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would strengthen the explanation.\n\n2. **Explicit Final Format:**\n   - The final answer could be better formatted. Instead of concluding with a formal boxed answer twice, consolidating it to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{The equation of the plane is } x - 3z = 0 \\quad \\text{in the form } Ax + By + Cz + D = 0:\n     \\]\n     followed by the boxed final answer immediately.\n\n3. **Completeness:**\n   - Include a statement reflecting that \\(y\\) is free to take any value, emphasizing that the results are consistent with the realization of a plane.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the original answer is correct in terms of logic and calculation, enhancing clarity, depth in explanation, and presentation would improve the overall quality. Highlighting the plane's nature connected to the vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) and subtly emphasizing geometric interpretation alongside algebra would provide a more complete response.\n\n### Revised Final Answer:\nAfter considering the feedback, the improved final answer can be summarized as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{The equation of the plane is } x - 3z = 0 \\text{ or } 1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n\\]\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{x - 3z = 0} \\n#### x - 3z = 0\\).",

            "Certainly! Let’s analyze the previous answer provided step by step, addressing any imperfections or areas that require clarification or improvement. \n\n### 1. Correctness of the Concept:\n- The answer correctly identifies the fundamental requirement that the projection \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) implies \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\). This is a critical point and forms the basis of finding the equation of the plane. \n\n### 2. Calculation of Projection:\n- The projection calculation was not explicitly shown in the completed response, which is acceptable since the key point derived from it (\\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\)) was correctly utilized.\n- However, it would improve clarity to explicitly state that \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0\\) is the condition for orthogonality.\n\n### 3. Setting Up the Dot Product:\n- The response correctly assigns \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\\) and calculates \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) as \\(x - 3z = 0\\).\n- The resulting equation is \\(x = 3z\\). This step is clearly stated and derives the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) effectively.\n\n### 4. Formulating the Plane Equation:\n- The transition to the plane equation \\(x - 3z = 0\\) translates well into the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) as \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0\\).\n- However, this was not presented with sufficient clarity. It is important to state that this format fits the required \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) and to explicitly identify the coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) after this transformation.\n\n### 5. Verification of Conditions:\n- The answer provides the coefficient values correctly: \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\).\n- It also correctly checks the condition \\(A > 0\\) and shows \\(\\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1\\), which fulfills the requirements.\n  \n### 6. Final Presentation:\n- The final boxed answer is right; however, the presentation could be improved by clearly stating that the final equation of the plane is \\(x - 3z = 0\\).\n- Overall, the answer would benefit from clearer organization and articulation, particularly in justifying each transformation step and explaining what each transformation means regarding the problem at hand.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- Ensure clarity in each step by being explicit about the underlying reasonings. \n- Clearly distinguish between steps and maintain a logical flow, making connections between concepts more explicit.\n- Include all calculations and transformations in a way that reinforces understanding.\n  \n### Suggested Revised Answer:\nTo effectively communicate this solution, a revised answer would begin with clearly defined steps, addressing the above critique while ensuring thoroughness and clarity throughout the reasoning process.\n\n### Revised Answer:\nLet's synthesize these points into a final structured answer:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nThe projection of vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is given by \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v}\\).

            "To critically analyze the provided answer, we'll go through each step of the reasoning process to identify flaws, clarify any misunderstandings, and ensure that the answer meets the requirements set in the problem. \n\n### Review of the Steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Projection Concept:**\n   - The definition and formula for the projection of one vector onto another are correctly stated. The calculation of the projection being zero relates directly to the dot product being zero, which is crucial for finding the plane.\n\n2. **Dot Product Calculation:**\n   - The computation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is accurate:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 10.\n     \\]\n   - The expression for \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is also correctly formulated:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x - 3z.\n     \\]\n   - Setting this dot product to zero is correctly derived. However, the subsequent expression could have been set more explicitly:\n     \\[\n     x - 3z = 0 \\implies x = 3z.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Forming the Plane Equation:**\n   - The derivation of the equation \\(x - 3z = 0\\) is correctly followed, leading to the correct representation in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the coefficients are identified as \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\). This is accurate.\n\n4. **Condition Checks:**\n   - The conditions \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\\) are verified correctly, yielding:\n     \\[\n     \\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the response satisfies the conditions outlined in the problem.\n\n### Feedback to Improve the Answer:\n1. **Clarity and Detail in Explanation:**\n   - While the steps are correct, the clarity can be improved. Explicitly stating that the dot product being zero indicates that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) lies in the plane orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would enhance understanding.\n   - Introducing the geometrical interpretation that vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that meet the criteria lie on a plane orthogonal to the direction of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would strengthen the explanation.\n\n2. **Explicit Final Format:**\n   - The final answer could be better formatted. Instead of concluding with a formal boxed answer twice, consolidating it to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{The equation of the plane is } x - 3z = 0 \\quad \\text{in the form } Ax + By + Cz + D = 0:\n     \\]\n     followed by the boxed final answer immediately.\n\n3. **Completeness:**\n   - Include a statement reflecting that \\(y\\) is free to take any value, emphasizing that the results are consistent with the realization of a plane.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the original answer is correct in terms of logic and calculation, enhancing clarity, depth in explanation, and presentation would improve the overall quality.

The calculation of the projection being zero relates directly to the dot product being zero, which is crucial for finding the plane.\n\n2. **Dot Product Calculation:**\n   - The computation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is accurate:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 10.\n     \\]\n   - The expression for \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is also correctly formulated:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = x - 3z.\n     \\]\n   - Setting this dot product to zero is correctly derived. However, the subsequent expression could have been set more explicitly:\n     \\[\n     x - 3z = 0 \\implies x = 3z.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Forming the Plane Equation:**\n   - The derivation of the equation \\(x - 3z = 0\\) is correctly followed, leading to the correct representation in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the coefficients are identified as \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\).

Explicitly stating that the dot product being zero indicates that \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) lies in the plane orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would enhance understanding.\n   - Introducing the geometrical interpretation that vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) that meet the criteria lie on a plane orthogonal to the direction of \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) would strengthen the explanation.\n\n2. **Explicit Final Format:**\n   - The final answer could be better formatted. Instead of concluding with a formal boxed answer twice, consolidating it to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{The equation of the plane is } x - 3z = 0 \\quad \\text{in the form } Ax + By + Cz + D = 0:\n     \\]\n     followed by the boxed final answer immediately.\n\n3. **Completeness:**\n   - Include a statement reflecting that \\(y\\) is free to take any value, emphasizing that the results are consistent with the realization of a plane.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the original answer is correct in terms of logic and calculation, enhancing clarity, depth in explanation, and presentation would improve the overall quality.

This implies that the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) must be orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{w}\\).

            "Let's analyze the previous response step by step, pointing out any flaws and areas where clarity could be improved.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n**Flaw:** The initial explanation regarding the projection formula is mostly accurate, but it could be made clearer to specify why \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) necessitates \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\).

While it gets to the right dot product, the transition could be smoother, pointing out the connection to orthogonality clearly.\n\n### Step 3: Setting up the Equation\n**Flaw:** The response provides the simplified form as \\(x - 3z = 0\\) but does not appropriately discuss how this relates back to the required format of \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\). It's important to clearly highlight how the equation is transformed into the standard form, ensuring the reader follows through.\n\n### Step 4: Coefficient Conditions\n**Flaw:** The final part about checking \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\\) is present but could be better illustrated. Although it does correctly identify that \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), and \\(D = 0\\), illustrating how \\(|B|\\) and \\(|D|\\) don't affect the gcd would make the explanation more complete.\n\n### Final Answer Formatting\n**Flaw:** The formatting of the final answer could lead to confusion. It's presented in a way that might suggest two different answers are being provided. Clarifying that the boxed answer should just be the equation of the plane would enhance clarity.\n\n### Overall Feedback:\n- **Clarity and Structure:** Maintain clearer links between definitions, formulas, and final derivations. Each logical step should build on the previous one without assumptive jumps.\n- **Detailed Justifications:** Make sure every conclusion is motivated by a thorough explanation of underlying principles, especially regarding vector operations.\n- **Consistency in Final Presentation:** Ensure that the final answer is unambiguous.

            "Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas that could be improved. We'll break it down into logical components to ensure clarity and thoroughness.\n\n### Breakdown of the Original Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - The problem states that \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\), meaning the projection of vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) must be the zero vector.\n   - The solution correctly interprets this condition as requiring the dot product \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\).\n\n2. **Calculation of the Dot Product**:\n   - The calculation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is unnecessary since the question requires only the dot product \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\). While this part is correct, it introduces a bit of extra information that isn't needed to understand the relationship.\n\n3. **Setting up the Equation**:\n   - The dot product was calculated as \\(v_1 - 3v_3 = 0\\), leading to \\(v_1 = 3v_3\\). This is accurate and demonstrates the relationship needed for vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) to lie in the desired plane. However, a bit more clarity could have been provided regarding the form of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) in terms of free variables.\n\n4. **Finding the Plane Equation**:\n   - The transformation to the plane equation \\(v_1 - 3v_3 = 0\\) was stated, but the connection to the standard form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) could have been presented more explicitly. The conversion step could have been elaborated to avoid confusion.\n\n5. **Identification of Coefficients**:\n   - The coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) were identified correctly. However, the final equation of the plane was written as \\(x - 3z = 0\\), which lacks \\(B\\) since \\(v_2\\) was ignored in the final representation of the plane equation. A complete expression should include all variables, reinforcing that \\(v_2\\) can take any value.\n\n6. **Checking Conditions**:\n   - The conditions \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\\) were checked, which were found to be satisfied. However, since we should also include \\(B\\) in the equation, the verification needs to reflect that. If \\(B = 0\\), then we should clearly indicate that this forms part of the condition for the plane.\n\n### Summary of Improvements Needed\n\n- **Clarity and Structure**: The explanation could benefit from more structured formatting and explicit connections between steps. Each transformational step should be clearly articulated.\n  \n- **Complete Representation of the Variables**: The final equation should include all variables \\(v_1\\), \\(v_2\\), and \\(v_3\\) in the plane equation format. The inclusion of \\(B\\) in the equation is essential for completeness and correctness.\n\n- **Verification Step Needs Enhancements**: Include a more robust verification process to ensure all values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are represented and checked appropriately.\n\n### Revised Answer\n\nTo correct these issues, the equation of the plane where \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) lies could be presented as follows:\n\nWe start with the condition \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\), which leads to:\n\n\\[\nv_1 - 3v_3 = 0 \\implies v_1 = 3v_3.\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that every vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) can be represented as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3v_3 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(v_2\\) is arbitrary. The equation of the plane can therefore be expressed in the form:\n\n\\[\nv_1 - 3v_3 + 0v_2 = 0 \\implies A = 1, B = 0, C = -3, D = 0.\n\\]\n\nFinally, the equation of the plane is:\n\n\\[\n1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0 \\implies x - 3z = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Final Correct Structural Answer\n\nThus, ensuring all conditions are satisfied, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x - 3z = 0} \\n#### x - 3z = 0.\n\\] \n\nThis keeps \\(v_2\\) free and emphasizes correct variable representation while adhering to the required form.",

However, it can enhance clarity by explicitly writing all terms in the equation.\n\n### Step 3: Coefficient Analysis\n\n1. **Identifying Coefficients**: The coefficients \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), and \\(D = 0\\) are correctly identified.\n\n2. **Checking Conditions**:\n   - The condition \\(A > 0\\) is satisfied. \n   - The calculation of \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|)\\) is correct, giving \\(1\\).\n\n### Step 4: Presentation of the Final Answer\n\n1. **Formatting**: The final answer section could be improved in its presentation. The expression \\(\\boxed{x - 3z = 0}\\) is not standard for a plane equation in the requested format. The response should present the equation in the form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) explicitly rather than in a simplified version.\n\n2. **Highlighting the Plane**: The response should reaffirm that \\(x - 3z = 0\\) represents a plane in three-dimensional space.

The provided solution correctly identifies that for this projection to be zero, we require \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\). This is an appropriate understanding of the problem.\n\n2. **Calculating the Dot Product**: The equation obtained from the dot product, \\(x - 3z = 0\\), is correctly derived.

However, it was less explicit in showing how this corresponds to a standard plane equation in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).\n\n4. **Standard Form Equation**:\n   - While you arrived at \\(x - 3z = 0\\), you then needed to express this in the required form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) clearly. You did recognize that this can be expressed as \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0\\), which is correct.\n   - However, clarity in transitioning from \\(x = 3z\\) to the standard form could have been improved. Clearly stating the transition from one to the other would enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Conditions Check**:\n   - You verified \\(A > 0\\) appropriately, stating that \\(A = 1\\) satisfies this condition.\n   - You also correctly calculated \\(\\gcd(|1|, |0|, |-3|, |0|)\\) to confirm it equals 1. This step is important, and you executed it correctly.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity in Explanation**: \n   - While the logic was generally correct, it could have been more readable by breaking down the transition to the plane equation with more explicit steps.\n\n2. **Comprehensiveness**:\n   - It would have been helpful to explain why the orthogonality condition leads to a plane, perhaps by mentioning that all vectors orthogonal to a given vector lie in a hyperplane (or plane in 3D space).\n\n3. **Formality and Structure**:\n   - The answer could have benefited from a more formal structure with a clearer distinction between reasoning, calculation, and final answer presentation.\n\n4. **Formatting of Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer should be represented clearly, focusing solely on the result rather than bundling it with explanations. The notation should be precise and standardized.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYour response was on the right track, demonstrating a solid understanding of the problem, but a few enhancements in clarity, structure, and completeness would significantly improve the presentation. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0}\\)  \n#### \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0\\) \n\nThese critical observations can help refine your writing and problem-solving process for future mathematical inquiries.

The provided solution correctly identifies that for this projection to be zero, we require \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\). This is an appropriate understanding of the problem.\n\n2. **Calculating the Dot Product**: The equation obtained from the dot product, \\(x - 3z = 0\\), is correctly derived. However, it's important to explicitly state where the components of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) (represented as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\\)) come from to avoid ambiguity. This ensures that the reader knows exactly how \\(x, y,\\) and \\(z\\) relate to the variables in the expression.\n\n3. **Rearranging the Equation**: The form provided, \\(x - 3z = 0\\), is a linear equation. However, to align with the required format \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\), the equation can be rewritten as:\n\n   \\[\n   1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0.\n   \\]\n\n   This is consistent with the form requested by the problem.

However, a more explicit check could have been provided for the greatest common divisor condition. The response states:\n\n   \\[\n   \\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1,\n   \\]\n\n   Although this is correct, it could have been clearer.

Correctness of the Concept:\n- The answer correctly identifies the fundamental requirement that the projection \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) implies \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\). This is a critical point and forms the basis of finding the equation of the plane. \n\n### 2. Calculation of Projection:\n- The projection calculation was not explicitly shown in the completed response, which is acceptable since the key point derived from it (\\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\)) was correctly utilized.\n- However, it would improve clarity to explicitly state that \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0\\) is the condition for orthogonality.\n\n### 3. Setting Up the Dot Product:\n- The response correctly assigns \\(\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix}\\) and calculates \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) as \\(x - 3z = 0\\).\n- The resulting equation is \\(x = 3z\\).

It is important to state that this format fits the required \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) and to explicitly identify the coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) after this transformation.\n\n### 5. Verification of Conditions:\n- The answer provides the coefficient values correctly: \\(A = 1\\), \\(B = 0\\), \\(C = -3\\), \\(D = 0\\).\n- It also correctly checks the condition \\(A > 0\\) and shows \\(\\gcd(1, 0, 3, 0) = 1\\), which fulfills the requirements.\n  \n### 6. Final Presentation:\n- The final boxed answer is right; however, the presentation could be improved by clearly stating that the final equation of the plane is \\(x - 3z = 0\\).\n- Overall, the answer would benefit from clearer organization and articulation, particularly in justifying each transformation step and explaining what each transformation means regarding the problem at hand.\n\n### Summary of Feedback:\n- Ensure clarity in each step by being explicit about the underlying reasonings. \n- Clearly distinguish between steps and maintain a logical flow, making connections between concepts more explicit.\n- Include all calculations and transformations in a way that reinforces understanding.\n  \n### Suggested Revised Answer:\nTo effectively communicate this solution, a revised answer would begin with clearly defined steps, addressing the above critique while ensuring thoroughness and clarity throughout the reasoning process.\n\n### Revised Answer:\nLet's synthesize these points into a final structured answer:\n\n### [Reasoning Process]\nThe projection of vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) is given by \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v}\\).

                "Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step and identify any flaws or areas that could be improved. We'll break it down into logical components to ensure clarity and thoroughness.\n\n### Breakdown of the Original Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - The problem states that \\(\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{w}} \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\), meaning the projection of vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) onto vector \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) must be the zero vector.\n   - The solution correctly interprets this condition as requiring the dot product \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\).\n\n2. **Calculation of the Dot Product**:\n   - The calculation of \\(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\) is unnecessary since the question requires only the dot product \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\). While this part is correct, it introduces a bit of extra information that isn't needed to understand the relationship.\n\n3. **Setting up the Equation**:\n   - The dot product was calculated as \\(v_1 - 3v_3 = 0\\), leading to \\(v_1 = 3v_3\\). This is accurate and demonstrates the relationship needed for vectors \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) to lie in the desired plane. However, a bit more clarity could have been provided regarding the form of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) in terms of free variables.\n\n4. **Finding the Plane Equation**:\n   - The transformation to the plane equation \\(v_1 - 3v_3 = 0\\) was stated, but the connection to the standard form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) could have been presented more explicitly. The conversion step could have been elaborated to avoid confusion.\n\n5. **Identification of Coefficients**:\n   - The coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) were identified correctly. However, the final equation of the plane was written as \\(x - 3z = 0\\), which lacks \\(B\\) since \\(v_2\\) was ignored in the final representation of the plane equation. A complete expression should include all variables, reinforcing that \\(v_2\\) can take any value.\n\n6. **Checking Conditions**:\n   - The conditions \\(A > 0\\) and \\(\\gcd(|A|, |B|, |C|, |D|) = 1\\) were checked, which were found to be satisfied. However, since we should also include \\(B\\) in the equation, the verification needs to reflect that. If \\(B = 0\\), then we should clearly indicate that this forms part of the condition for the plane.\n\n### Summary of Improvements Needed\n\n- **Clarity and Structure**: The explanation could benefit from more structured formatting and explicit connections between steps. Each transformational step should be clearly articulated.\n  \n- **Complete Representation of the Variables**: The final equation should include all variables \\(v_1\\), \\(v_2\\), and \\(v_3\\) in the plane equation format. The inclusion of \\(B\\) in the equation is essential for completeness and correctness.\n\n- **Verification Step Needs Enhancements**: Include a more robust verification process to ensure all values of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) are represented and checked appropriately.\n\n### Revised Answer\n\nTo correct these issues, the equation of the plane where \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) lies could be presented as follows:\n\nWe start with the condition \\(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\\), which leads to:\n\n\\[\nv_1 - 3v_3 = 0 \\implies v_1 = 3v_3.\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that every vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) can be represented as:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3v_3 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(v_2\\) is arbitrary. The equation of the plane can therefore be expressed in the form:\n\n\\[\nv_1 - 3v_3 + 0v_2 = 0 \\implies A = 1, B = 0, C = -3, D = 0.\n\\]\n\nFinally, the equation of the plane is:\n\n\\[\n1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0 \\implies x - 3z = 0.\n\\]\n\n### Final Correct Structural Answer\n\nThus, ensuring all conditions are satisfied, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x - 3z = 0} \\n#### x - 3z = 0.\n\\] \n\nThis keeps \\(v_2\\) free and emphasizes correct variable representation while adhering to the required form.",

However, it was less explicit in showing how this corresponds to a standard plane equation in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\).\n\n4. **Standard Form Equation**:\n   - While you arrived at \\(x - 3z = 0\\), you then needed to express this in the required form \\(Ax + By + Cz + D = 0\\) clearly. You did recognize that this can be expressed as \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0\\), which is correct.\n   - However, clarity in transitioning from \\(x = 3z\\) to the standard form could have been improved. Clearly stating the transition from one to the other would enhance understanding.\n\n5. **Conditions Check**:\n   - You verified \\(A > 0\\) appropriately, stating that \\(A = 1\\) satisfies this condition.\n   - You also correctly calculated \\(\\gcd(|1|, |0|, |-3|, |0|)\\) to confirm it equals 1. This step is important, and you executed it correctly.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n1. **Clarity in Explanation**: \n   - While the logic was generally correct, it could have been more readable by breaking down the transition to the plane equation with more explicit steps.\n\n2. **Comprehensiveness**:\n   - It would have been helpful to explain why the orthogonality condition leads to a plane, perhaps by mentioning that all vectors orthogonal to a given vector lie in a hyperplane (or plane in 3D space).\n\n3. **Formality and Structure**:\n   - The answer could have benefited from a more formal structure with a clearer distinction between reasoning, calculation, and final answer presentation.\n\n4. **Formatting of Final Answer**:\n   - The final answer should be represented clearly, focusing solely on the result rather than bundling it with explanations. The notation should be precise and standardized.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYour response was on the right track, demonstrating a solid understanding of the problem, but a few enhancements in clarity, structure, and completeness would significantly improve the presentation. \n\n[Final Answer] The answer is \\(\\boxed{1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0}\\)  \n#### \\(1x + 0y - 3z + 0 = 0\\) \n\nThese critical observations can help refine your writing and problem-solving process for future mathematical inquiries.
