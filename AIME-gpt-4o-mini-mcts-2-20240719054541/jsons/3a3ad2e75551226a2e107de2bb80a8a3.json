        "Let's analyze the previous reasoning process step by step to ensure clarity and precision while identifying any flaws or areas that could be improved.\n\n1. **Understanding the Functional Equation**:\n   The original equation given is \\((x-1)P(x+1)=(x+2)P(x)\\). We correctly noted that both sides of the equation have the same degree \\(d + 1\\). However, we could also clarify how we deduce the implications of this equation further. \n\n2. **Finding Roots**:\n   The evaluation of \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\) to find roots was correctly executed. The reasoning here is adequate, but it could have been more precise by commenting on why evaluating at those points leads to discovering roots (the reason being that one side becomes zero).\n\n3. **Forming the Polynomial**:\n   Here we wrote \\(P(x) = k(x-1)(x+1)Q(x)\\). This is logical, but there can be a broader consideration about what types of \\(Q(x)\\) would be valid polynomials (like constant polynomials that could lead to integer solutions). The assumption that \\(Q(x)\\) is a constant polynomial is reasonable, but it would have been good to validate that assumption through exploring possible degrees.\n\n4. **Applying the Condition**:\n   The condition \\((P(2))^2 = P(3)\\) was correctly handled, yet it may be useful to specify how we derive those specific values of \\(P(2)\\) and \\(P(3)\\). Proper commentary on substituting \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=3\\) can help the reader follow the logic.\n\n5. **Final Polynomial**:\n   The conclusion that \\(k = \\frac{8}{9}\\) is mathematically correct, but it might enhance clarity if we included steps that check whether other values might yield additional polynomials satisfying the functional constraints.\n\n6. **Final Result**:\n   The calculations for \\(P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\\) were presented correctly, but we should have ensured that every intermediate step is outlined distinctly to avoid assumptions that could lead to mistakes during evaluation. Each simplification should be treated with care to ensure no arithmetic errors occur.\n\n7. **Final Expression**:\n   The determination of coprimeness between \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) is a crucial conclusion and should have been underlined more emphatically to conclude the answer.\n\n### Summary of Key Flaws:\n- Lack of clarity in how roots were derived from the functional equation.\n- Insufficient exploration of the polynomial forms beyond the simplest case.\n- Missed highlighting intermediate steps when calculating values like \\(P(2)\\) and \\(P(3)\\).\n- Need for clearer assertions regarding coprimeness and thorough verification of integer conditions.\n\nIn terms of grading criteria, the solution might miss points due to lack of careful exposition, potential misunderstandings in polynomial forms, or minor arithmetic oversights. A deeper examination of underlying assumptions and thorough confirmation of calculated values could enhance the robustness of such a response.\n\n### Improvement Recommendations:\n- Clearly demonstrate why each point in the polynomial analysis leads to critical insights.\n- Provide detailed step-by-step calculations and reasoning for each evaluation to avoid any misunderstandings.\n- Confirm and validate assumptions about polynomials and constants, especially when concluding about forms.\n- Ensure that final answers are both mathematically correct and clearly articulated for easy understanding.\n\nThese adjustments would not only enhance clarity but also strengthen the mathematical argumentation, leading to a more comprehensive and reliable solution."

        "[reasoning process]\nWe start with the functional equation given for the polynomial \\(P(x)\\):\n\n\\[\n(x-1)P(x+1) = (x+2)P(x)\n\\]\n\nThis equation must hold for all real \\(x\\). By analyzing the degrees of the two sides, we can conclude that the degree of \\(P(x)\\) must be consistent. If we denote the degree of \\(P(x)\\) as \\(d\\), the left-hand side has a degree of \\(d + 1\\) and the right-hand side also has a degree of \\(d + 1\\). Since both sides are polynomials of the same degree, we can proceed by evaluating specific values of \\(x\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n(1-1)P(2) = (1+2)P(1) \\Rightarrow 0 = 3P(1)\n\\]\n\nThis shows \\(P(1) = 0\\), so \\(x=1\\) is a root of \\(P(x)\\). \n\nNext, substituting \\(x = -2\\):\n\n\\[\n(-2-1)P(-1) = (-2+2)P(-2) \\Rightarrow -3P(-1) = 0 \\Rightarrow P(-1) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis indicates that \\(x = -1\\) is another root of \\(P(x)\\), so we can express \\(P(x)\\) as:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = k(x-1)(x+1)Q(x) = k(x^2 - 1)Q(x)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Q(x)\\) is another polynomial. We also know that \\(P(x)\\) should be nonzero, meaning \\(Q(x)\\) must also be a polynomial.\n\nNext, substituting \\(x = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n(-1)P(1) = 2P(0) \\Rightarrow -P(1) = 2P(0) \\Rightarrow 0 = 2P(0)\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(P(0) = 0\\) implies that \\(x = 0\\) is also a root of \\(P(x)\\). Therefore, we rewrite \\(P\\) as:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = kx(x-1)(x+1) = kx(x^2 - 1) = kx^3 - kx\n\\]\n\nNow, \\(P(x)\\) must be of the form \\(kx^3 - kx\\) where \\(k\\) is some nonzero constant.\n\nNext, we apply the condition \\((P(2))^2 = P(3)\\):\n\nCalculating \\(P(2)\\):\n\n\\[\nP(2) = k(2^3 - 2) = k(8 - 2) = k \\cdot 6 = 6k\n\\]\n\nThen, calculating \\(P(3)\\):\n\n\\[\nP(3) = k(3^3 - 3) = k(27 - 3) = k \\cdot 24 = 24k\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the condition gives us:\n\n\\[\n(6k)^2 = 24k \\Rightarrow 36k^2 = 24k\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\(k \\neq 0\\), we can divide both sides by \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n36k = 24 \\Rightarrow k = \\frac{24}{36} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, we have the polynomial:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = \\frac{2}{3}(x^3 - x)\n\\]\n\nNow we compute \\(P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\\):\n\n\\[\nP\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^3 - \\frac{7}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{343}{8}\n\\]\n\nNow substituting back:\n\n\\[\nP\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{343}{8} - \\frac{7}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nTo combine the terms in the parentheses, we convert \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\) to have an 8 denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{2} = \\frac{28}{8}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{343}{8} - \\frac{28}{8} = \\frac{315}{8}\n\\]\n\nNow substituting back into \\(P\\):\n\n\\[\nP\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{315}{8}\\right) = \\frac{630}{24} = \\frac{105}{4}\n\\]\n\nLastly, identifying \\(m\\) and \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{105}{4} \\Rightarrow m = 105, \\ n = 4\n\\]\n\nThus \\(m + n = 105 + 4\\).\n\n[Verification]\nIn finding \\(P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\\) we consistently applied the functional equation and conditions, calculating systematically.

            "Let's analyze the previous reasoning process step by step to ensure clarity and precision while identifying any flaws or areas that could be improved.\n\n1. **Understanding the Functional Equation**:\n   The original equation given is \\((x-1)P(x+1)=(x+2)P(x)\\). We correctly noted that both sides of the equation have the same degree \\(d + 1\\). However, we could also clarify how we deduce the implications of this equation further. \n\n2. **Finding Roots**:\n   The evaluation of \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\) to find roots was correctly executed. The reasoning here is adequate, but it could have been more precise by commenting on why evaluating at those points leads to discovering roots (the reason being that one side becomes zero).\n\n3. **Forming the Polynomial**:\n   Here we wrote \\(P(x) = k(x-1)(x+1)Q(x)\\). This is logical, but there can be a broader consideration about what types of \\(Q(x)\\) would be valid polynomials (like constant polynomials that could lead to integer solutions). The assumption that \\(Q(x)\\) is a constant polynomial is reasonable, but it would have been good to validate that assumption through exploring possible degrees.\n\n4. **Applying the Condition**:\n   The condition \\((P(2))^2 = P(3)\\) was correctly handled, yet it may be useful to specify how we derive those specific values of \\(P(2)\\) and \\(P(3)\\). Proper commentary on substituting \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=3\\) can help the reader follow the logic.\n\n5. **Final Polynomial**:\n   The conclusion that \\(k = \\frac{8}{9}\\) is mathematically correct, but it might enhance clarity if we included steps that check whether other values might yield additional polynomials satisfying the functional constraints.\n\n6. **Final Result**:\n   The calculations for \\(P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\\) were presented correctly, but we should have ensured that every intermediate step is outlined distinctly to avoid assumptions that could lead to mistakes during evaluation. Each simplification should be treated with care to ensure no arithmetic errors occur.\n\n7. **Final Expression**:\n   The determination of coprimeness between \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) is a crucial conclusion and should have been underlined more emphatically to conclude the answer.\n\n### Summary of Key Flaws:\n- Lack of clarity in how roots were derived from the functional equation.\n- Insufficient exploration of the polynomial forms beyond the simplest case.\n- Missed highlighting intermediate steps when calculating values like \\(P(2)\\) and \\(P(3)\\).\n- Need for clearer assertions regarding coprimeness and thorough verification of integer conditions.\n\nIn terms of grading criteria, the solution might miss points due to lack of careful exposition, potential misunderstandings in polynomial forms, or minor arithmetic oversights. A deeper examination of underlying assumptions and thorough confirmation of calculated values could enhance the robustness of such a response.\n\n### Improvement Recommendations:\n- Clearly demonstrate why each point in the polynomial analysis leads to critical insights.\n- Provide detailed step-by-step calculations and reasoning for each evaluation to avoid any misunderstandings.\n- Confirm and validate assumptions about polynomials and constants, especially when concluding about forms.\n- Ensure that final answers are both mathematically correct and clearly articulated for easy understanding.\n\nThese adjustments would not only enhance clarity but also strengthen the mathematical argumentation, leading to a more comprehensive and reliable solution."

            "Let's analyze the previous reasoning process step by step to ensure clarity and precision while identifying any flaws or areas that could be improved.\n\n1. **Understanding the Functional Equation**:\n   The original equation given is \\((x-1)P(x+1)=(x+2)P(x)\\). We correctly noted that both sides of the equation have the same degree \\(d + 1\\). However, we could also clarify how we deduce the implications of this equation further. \n\n2. **Finding Roots**:\n   The evaluation of \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\) to find roots was correctly executed. The reasoning here is adequate, but it could have been more precise by commenting on why evaluating at those points leads to discovering roots (the reason being that one side becomes zero).\n\n3. **Forming the Polynomial**:\n   Here we wrote \\(P(x) = k(x-1)(x+1)Q(x)\\). This is logical, but there can be a broader consideration about what types of \\(Q(x)\\) would be valid polynomials (like constant polynomials that could lead to integer solutions). The assumption that \\(Q(x)\\) is a constant polynomial is reasonable, but it would have been good to validate that assumption through exploring possible degrees.\n\n4. **Applying the Condition**:\n   The condition \\((P(2))^2 = P(3)\\) was correctly handled, yet it may be useful to specify how we derive those specific values of \\(P(2)\\) and \\(P(3)\\). Proper commentary on substituting \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=3\\) can help the reader follow the logic.\n\n5. **Final Polynomial**:\n   The conclusion that \\(k = \\frac{8}{9}\\) is mathematically correct, but it might enhance clarity if we included steps that check whether other values might yield additional polynomials satisfying the functional constraints.\n\n6. **Final Result**:\n   The calculations for \\(P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\\) were presented correctly, but we should have ensured that every intermediate step is outlined distinctly to avoid assumptions that could lead to mistakes during evaluation. Each simplification should be treated with care to ensure no arithmetic errors occur.\n\n7. **Final Expression**:\n   The determination of coprimeness between \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) is a crucial conclusion and should have been underlined more emphatically to conclude the answer.\n\n### Summary of Key Flaws:\n- Lack of clarity in how roots were derived from the functional equation.\n- Insufficient exploration of the polynomial forms beyond the simplest case.\n- Missed highlighting intermediate steps when calculating values like \\(P(2)\\) and \\(P(3)\\).\n- Need for clearer assertions regarding coprimeness and thorough verification of integer conditions.\n\nIn terms of grading criteria, the solution might miss points due to lack of careful exposition, potential misunderstandings in polynomial forms, or minor arithmetic oversights. A deeper examination of underlying assumptions and thorough confirmation of calculated values could enhance the robustness of such a response.\n\n### Improvement Recommendations:\n- Clearly demonstrate why each point in the polynomial analysis leads to critical insights.\n- Provide detailed step-by-step calculations and reasoning for each evaluation to avoid any misunderstandings.\n- Confirm and validate assumptions about polynomials and constants, especially when concluding about forms.\n- Ensure that final answers are both mathematically correct and clearly articulated for easy understanding.\n\nThese adjustments would not only enhance clarity but also strengthen the mathematical argumentation, leading to a more comprehensive and reliable solution.",

Therefore, we rewrite \\(P\\) as:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = kx(x-1)(x+1) = kx(x^2 - 1) = kx^3 - kx\n\\]\n\nNow, \\(P(x)\\) must be of the form \\(kx^3 - kx\\) where \\(k\\) is some nonzero constant.\n\nNext, we apply the condition \\((P(2))^2 = P(3)\\):\n\nCalculating \\(P(2)\\):\n\n\\[\nP(2) = k(2^3 - 2) = k(8 - 2) = k \\cdot 6 = 6k\n\\]\n\nThen, calculating \\(P(3)\\):\n\n\\[\nP(3) = k(3^3 - 3) = k(27 - 3) = k \\cdot 24 = 24k\n\\]\n\nSubstituting into the condition gives us:\n\n\\[\n(6k)^2 = 24k \\Rightarrow 36k^2 = 24k\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\(k \\neq 0\\), we can divide both sides by \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n36k = 24 \\Rightarrow k = \\frac{24}{36} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, we have the polynomial:\n\n\\[\nP(x) = \\frac{2}{3}(x^3 - x)\n\\]\n\nNow we compute \\(P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\\):\n\n\\[\nP\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^3 - \\frac{7}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{343}{8}\n\\]\n\nNow substituting back:\n\n\\[\nP\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{343}{8} - \\frac{7}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nTo combine the terms in the parentheses, we convert \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\) to have an 8 denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{2} = \\frac{28}{8}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{343}{8} - \\frac{28}{8} = \\frac{315}{8}\n\\]\n\nNow substituting back into \\(P\\):\n\n\\[\nP\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{315}{8}\\right) = \\frac{630}{24} = \\frac{105}{4}\n\\]\n\nLastly, identifying \\(m\\) and \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{105}{4} \\Rightarrow m = 105, \\ n = 4\n\\]\n\nThus \\(m + n = 105 + 4\\).\n\n[Verification]\nIn finding \\(P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\\) we consistently applied the functional equation and conditions, calculating systematically. The values derived align with the polynomial structure derived from roots and the given conditions about \\(P(2)\\) and \\(P(3)\\).\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 109 \\n#### 109": []

        "Let's denote the degree of \\( P(x) \\) as \\( d \\). The given functional equation is \n\n\\[\n(x-1)P(x+1) = (x+2)P(x).\n\\]\n\nWe can analyze the degrees on both sides of the equation.\n\n1. **Degree Analysis**:\n   - The left side has degree \\( d + 1 \\) because \\( P(x+1) \\) has degree \\( d \\) and multiplying by \\( (x-1) \\) increases the degree by 1.\n   - The right side has degree \\( d + 1 \\) for the same reason: \\( P(x) \\) is degree \\( d \\) and multiplying by \\( (x+2) \\) increases it by 1.\n\nThus, both sides of the equation indeed have the same degree \\( d + 1 \\).\n\n2. **Finding Roots**:\n   We can evaluate the functional equation at specific points to find the roots of \\( P(x) \\):\n   - Set \\( x = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     0 \\cdot P(2) = 3 \\cdot P(1) \\implies P(1) = 0.\n     \\]\n     So, \\( x = 1 \\) is a root of \\( P(x) \\).\n\n   - Set \\( x = -2 \\):\n     \\[\n     (-3)P(-1) = 0 \\cdot P(-2) \\implies P(-1) = 0.\n     \\]\n     So, \\( x = -1 \\) is also a root of \\( P(x) \\).\n\n3. **Form of Polynomial**:\n   Since \\( 1 \\) and \\(-1\\) are roots, we can express \\( P(x) \\) as \\( P(x) = k(x-1)(x+1)Q(x) \\) for some polynomial \\( Q(x) \\).\n\n4. **Finding Degrees**:\n   Now let’s determine the degree of \\( P(x) \\):\n   - If \\( P(x) \\) is of degree \\( d \\), then \\( (x-1)(x+1) \\) contributes \\( 2 \\) to the degree. Thus, \\( \\deg(Q) = d - 2 \\).\n\n5. **Substituting back**:\n   Substitute \\( P(x) \\) back into the original functional equation and solve. \n\n   A reasonable method at this point is to consider if \\( Q(x) \\) is a non-zero polynomial, and let's assume the simplest case, \\( Q(x) = c \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant. Hence,\n   \\[\n   P(x) = k(x-1)(x+1) = k(x^2 - 1).\n   \\]\n\n6. **Condition Evaluation**:\n   The second condition states:\n   \\[ \n   (P(2))^2 = P(3). \n   \\]\n   Calculate \\( P(2) \\) and \\( P(3) \\):\n   \\[\n   P(2) = k(2^2 - 1) = k(4 - 1) = 3k,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P(3) = k(3^2 - 1) = k(9 - 1) = 8k.\n   \\]\n   Plugging into the condition:\n   \\[\n   (3k)^2 = 8k \\implies 9k^2 = 8k \\implies 9k^2 - 8k = 0 \\implies k(9k - 8) = 0.\n   \\]\n   We conclude \\( k \\neq 0 \\), so \\( 9k - 8 = 0 \\implies k = \\frac{8}{9} \\).\n\n7. **Final Polynomial**:\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   P(x) = \\frac{8}{9}(x^2 - 1) = \\frac{8}{9}(x - 1)(x + 1).\n   \\]\n\n8. **Finding \\( P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) \\)**:\n   Now we compute \\( P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) \\):\n   \\[\n   P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = \\frac{8}{9}\\left(\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 - 1\\right) = \\frac{8}{9}\\left(\\frac{49}{4} - 1\\right) = \\frac{8}{9}\\left(\\frac{49}{4} - \\frac{4}{4}\\right) = \\frac{8}{9}\\left(\\frac{45}{4}\\right).\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = \\frac{8 \\cdot 45}{9 \\cdot 4} = \\frac{360}{36} = 10.\n   \\]\n\n9. **Final Expression**:\n   Here, we express \\( P\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) \\) as \\( \\frac{10}{1} \\) where \\( m = 10 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\) are coprime.\n\n**Final Answer**: The answer is \\( m + n = 10 + 1 = 11 \\)  \n#### 11": 50.0
