        "[reasoning process]  \nFirst, we need to calculate how many days Lauren will take to complete each type of picture scene based on her daily drawing capacity.\n\n1. **Large-Sized Picture Scenes**:\n   Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day. She needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes.  \n   Days required = Total large scenes / Large scenes per day  \n   Days required = 45 / 5 = 9 days.\n\n2. **Medium-Sized Picture Scenes**:\n   Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day. She needs to create 36 medium-sized picture scenes.  \n   Days required = Total medium scenes / Medium scenes per day  \n   Days required = 36 / 6 = 6 days.\n\n3. **Small-Sized Picture Scenes**:\n   Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day. She needs to create 49 small-sized picture scenes.  \n   Days required = Total small scenes / Small scenes per day  \n   Days required = 49 / 7 = 7 days.\n\nNow, we add the number of days it takes for each type of scene:\nTotal days = Days for large + Days for medium + Days for small  \nTotal days = 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days.\n\n[Verification]  \nLet's double-check the calculations:\n- For large scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes/day = 9 days. This is correct.\n- For medium scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes/day = 6 days. This is correct.\n- For small scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes/day = 7 days. This is correct.\n\nSumming the days again: 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days. This calculation is also verified.\n\n[Final Answer] The answer is 22  \n#### 22",
