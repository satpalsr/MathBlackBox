        "Let's carefully analyze the previous solution step by step and identify its flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. Misinterpretation and Lack of Structure\n\n- **Initial Setup**: The original answer did not clearly outline the method for how it approached finding suitable \\(t\\) values for forming an arithmetic progression. It jumped between various trials without a structured approach or explicit reasoning. A proper method should have been employed first to explicitly set the expectation of what constitutes an arithmetic progression.\n\n### 2. Incorrect Exploration of Values\n\n- **Angle Selection**: The examples given did not explore a comprehensive enough set of angles. The chosen angles like \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) do not sufficiently cover the periodic nature of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions and how they relate to their inverse functions. More strategic angles, including multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), or even angles that yield clearer differences, should have been emphasized.\n\n### 3. Output Analysis\n\n- **Arithmetic Progression Condition**: While it correctly mentioned the condition for an arithmetic progression \\((2b = a + c)\\), it didn't systematically check this condition for all tested \\(t\\) values. Each computed \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) should have been explicitly compared to verify the arithmetic progression, rather than relying on indirect reasoning.\n\n### 4. Inaccurate Conclusions\n\n- **Final \\(t\\) Value**: The concluding value \\( \\frac{5\\pi}{4} \\) was presented without proper justification or checking of whether that value indeed satisfied the AP condition. A calculated angle must lead to a set where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) clearly forms the arithmetic sequence; hence, the failure to check the specific conditions for that final value is a significant oversight.\n\n### 5. Notation and Clarity\n\n- **Notational Errors**: The notation for the outputs from the inverse functions could have been expressed in clearer terms. Specifically, clarity in how to define the output ranges of each function and what transformations applied should have been established first.\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\n\n1. **Logical Framework**: Establish a clear logical framework to explore values of \\(t\\). Start from basic properties of the functions, clearly outline ranges, and document how changes to \\(t\\) affect outputs.\n\n2. **Diverse Angle Selection**: Rather than testing a few angles, develop a systematic way to test combinations of angles that might yield results. Consider using angles that reflect symmetries in the unit circle as these might reveal interesting properties.\n\n3. **Explicit AP Verification**: Clearly compute and verify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) for each angle and explicitly state when they satisfy the arithmetic progression condition.\n\n4. **Final Validation**: For any candidate \\(t\\) values, validate by explicitly checking if they indeed lead to nonzero common differences while remaining within the stated function outputs.\n\n5. **Presentation**: Increase clarity in presentation. Use bullet points or a stepwise format when outlining the reasoning process to make it easier to follow.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the original solution lacked a structured approach to explore the problem, made calculations without clear checks against the requirements for arithmetic progressions, and failed to present a validated candidate for \\(t\\). Significant improvements can be made through rigorous systematic exploration of the problem, ensuring that all conditions are explicitly checked and verified, and presenting findings in a clearer manner. This structured approach will yield a more robust and correct solution.\n",
        "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step and evaluate its flaws:\n\n### Flaw 1: Incomplete Exploration of Values\nThe initial exploration of \\( t \\) values only examined specific angles: \\( 0 \\), \\( \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\), \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), and \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\). While \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\) was eventually identified as a solution, the exploration did not check values beyond \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\), especially multiples of \\( \\pi \\) or \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), which could potentially yield valid solutions.\n\n#### Suggested Improvement:\nTo ensure a complete search, one should systematically check a wider range of values \\( t \\), including angles around \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\) and also negative angles since \\( \\sin(-t) = -\\sin(t) \\), \\( \\cos(-t) = \\cos(t) \\), and \\( \\tan(-t) = -\\tan(t) \\).\n\n### Flaw 2: Lack of Generality in the AP Condition\nThe arithmetic progression was only verified for \\( 2b = a + c \\) without considering all possible permutations of \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\). The inputs could also satisfy \\( 2a = b + c \\) or \\( 2c = a + b \\).\n\n#### Suggested Improvement:\nList all permutations and check each condition of the arithmetic progression. Specifically, capturing all combinations and considering their ranges would lead to a thorough solution.\n\n### Flaw 3: No Consideration for Common Differences\nThe problem states that the common difference must be nonzero. It was implicitly assumed when finding values that the differences were nonzero without explicit verification.\n\n#### Suggested Improvement:\nExplicitly check that the common difference (even if it’s negative) is indeed non-zero after determining the values of \\( a, b, c \\).\n\n### Flaw 4: Lack of Clear Logical Deduction\nWhile the conclusion reached \\( t = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\), the reasoning could have been more concise, and clarifying why this is indeed the least positive value could improve the logic.\n\n#### Suggested Improvement:\nWrite out the process of narrowing down candidates for \\( t \\) and emphasize how you determined that \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\) is indeed the least value meeting the conditions.\n\n### A More Robust Approach\n\n1. **List All Functions**:\n    - Determine the effective outputs of \\( \\operatorname{Arcsin}, \\operatorname{Arccos}, \\operatorname{Arctan} \\) for general \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Enumerate Further**:\n    - Include considerations for additional trigonometric values, such as \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\), etc.\n\n3. **Check All Permutations**:\n    - Write down the arithmetic progression conditions explicitly for each combination, ensuring verification at each step.\n\n4. **Verify Nonzero Common Difference**:\n    - Ensure that the solutions not only progress arithmetically but also confirm that differences are non-zero.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy systematically addressing each point and ensuring a thorough check across all essential conditions, one can arrive at a more comprehensive solution that doesn't miss potential valid values of \\( t \\). \n\nIn summary, while the previous response reached a solution, the analysis showcases several oversights and areas for improvement, suggesting a more robust and thorough approach to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n### Suggested Correction Steps\n1. Recheck values of \\( t \\), including fractions and multiples of \\( \\pi \\).\n2. Consider and verify all permutations for the arithmetic sequence.\n3. Include conditions for non-zero differences. \n\n### Reflection\nApplying the above tips and enhancing the overall rigor of the analysis will lead to a stronger and more definitive solution."

            "Let's carefully analyze the previous solution step by step and identify its flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. Misinterpretation and Lack of Structure\n\n- **Initial Setup**: The original answer did not clearly outline the method for how it approached finding suitable \\(t\\) values for forming an arithmetic progression. It jumped between various trials without a structured approach or explicit reasoning. A proper method should have been employed first to explicitly set the expectation of what constitutes an arithmetic progression.\n\n### 2. Incorrect Exploration of Values\n\n- **Angle Selection**: The examples given did not explore a comprehensive enough set of angles. The chosen angles like \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) do not sufficiently cover the periodic nature of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions and how they relate to their inverse functions. More strategic angles, including multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), or even angles that yield clearer differences, should have been emphasized.\n\n### 3. Output Analysis\n\n- **Arithmetic Progression Condition**: While it correctly mentioned the condition for an arithmetic progression \\((2b = a + c)\\), it didn't systematically check this condition for all tested \\(t\\) values. Each computed \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) should have been explicitly compared to verify the arithmetic progression, rather than relying on indirect reasoning.\n\n### 4. Inaccurate Conclusions\n\n- **Final \\(t\\) Value**: The concluding value \\( \\frac{5\\pi}{4} \\) was presented without proper justification or checking of whether that value indeed satisfied the AP condition. A calculated angle must lead to a set where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) clearly forms the arithmetic sequence; hence, the failure to check the specific conditions for that final value is a significant oversight.\n\n### 5. Notation and Clarity\n\n- **Notational Errors**: The notation for the outputs from the inverse functions could have been expressed in clearer terms. Specifically, clarity in how to define the output ranges of each function and what transformations applied should have been established first.\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\n\n1. **Logical Framework**: Establish a clear logical framework to explore values of \\(t\\). Start from basic properties of the functions, clearly outline ranges, and document how changes to \\(t\\) affect outputs.\n\n2. **Diverse Angle Selection**: Rather than testing a few angles, develop a systematic way to test combinations of angles that might yield results. Consider using angles that reflect symmetries in the unit circle as these might reveal interesting properties.\n\n3. **Explicit AP Verification**: Clearly compute and verify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) for each angle and explicitly state when they satisfy the arithmetic progression condition.\n\n4. **Final Validation**: For any candidate \\(t\\) values, validate by explicitly checking if they indeed lead to nonzero common differences while remaining within the stated function outputs.\n\n5. **Presentation**: Increase clarity in presentation. Use bullet points or a stepwise format when outlining the reasoning process to make it easier to follow.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the original solution lacked a structured approach to explore the problem, made calculations without clear checks against the requirements for arithmetic progressions, and failed to present a validated candidate for \\(t\\). Significant improvements can be made through rigorous systematic exploration of the problem, ensuring that all conditions are explicitly checked and verified, and presenting findings in a clearer manner. This structured approach will yield a more robust and correct solution.\n"

            "Certainly!

While \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\) was eventually identified as a solution, the exploration did not check values beyond \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\), especially multiples of \\( \\pi \\) or \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), which could potentially yield valid solutions.\n\n#### Suggested Improvement:\nTo ensure a complete search, one should systematically check a wider range of values \\( t \\), including angles around \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\) and also negative angles since \\( \\sin(-t) = -\\sin(t) \\), \\( \\cos(-t) = \\cos(t) \\), and \\( \\tan(-t) = -\\tan(t) \\).\n\n### Flaw 2: Lack of Generality in the AP Condition\nThe arithmetic progression was only verified for \\( 2b = a + c \\) without considering all possible permutations of \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\). The inputs could also satisfy \\( 2a = b + c \\) or \\( 2c = a + b \\).\n\n#### Suggested Improvement:\nList all permutations and check each condition of the arithmetic progression. Specifically, capturing all combinations and considering their ranges would lead to a thorough solution.\n\n### Flaw 3: No Consideration for Common Differences\nThe problem states that the common difference must be nonzero. It was implicitly assumed when finding values that the differences were nonzero without explicit verification.\n\n#### Suggested Improvement:\nExplicitly check that the common difference (even if it’s negative) is indeed non-zero after determining the values of \\( a, b, c \\).\n\n### Flaw 4: Lack of Clear Logical Deduction\nWhile the conclusion reached \\( t = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\), the reasoning could have been more concise, and clarifying why this is indeed the least positive value could improve the logic.\n\n#### Suggested Improvement:\nWrite out the process of narrowing down candidates for \\( t \\) and emphasize how you determined that \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\) is indeed the least value meeting the conditions.\n\n### A More Robust Approach\n\n1. **List All Functions**:\n    - Determine the effective outputs of \\( \\operatorname{Arcsin}, \\operatorname{Arccos}, \\operatorname{Arctan} \\) for general \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Enumerate Further**:\n    - Include considerations for additional trigonometric values, such as \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\), etc.\n\n3. **Check All Permutations**:\n    - Write down the arithmetic progression conditions explicitly for each combination, ensuring verification at each step.\n\n4. **Verify Nonzero Common Difference**:\n    - Ensure that the solutions not only progress arithmetically but also confirm that differences are non-zero.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy systematically addressing each point and ensuring a thorough check across all essential conditions, one can arrive at a more comprehensive solution that doesn't miss potential valid values of \\( t \\). \n\nIn summary, while the previous response reached a solution, the analysis showcases several oversights and areas for improvement, suggesting a more robust and thorough approach to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n### Suggested Correction Steps\n1. Recheck values of \\( t \\), including fractions and multiples of \\( \\pi \\).\n2. Consider and verify all permutations for the arithmetic sequence.\n3. Include conditions for non-zero differences. \n\n### Reflection\nApplying the above tips and enhancing the overall rigor of the analysis will lead to a stronger and more definitive solution."

            "Let's carefully analyze the previous solution step by step and identify its flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. Misinterpretation and Lack of Structure\n\n- **Initial Setup**: The original answer did not clearly outline the method for how it approached finding suitable \\(t\\) values for forming an arithmetic progression. It jumped between various trials without a structured approach or explicit reasoning. A proper method should have been employed first to explicitly set the expectation of what constitutes an arithmetic progression.\n\n### 2. Incorrect Exploration of Values\n\n- **Angle Selection**: The examples given did not explore a comprehensive enough set of angles. The chosen angles like \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) do not sufficiently cover the periodic nature of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions and how they relate to their inverse functions. More strategic angles, including multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), or even angles that yield clearer differences, should have been emphasized.\n\n### 3. Output Analysis\n\n- **Arithmetic Progression Condition**: While it correctly mentioned the condition for an arithmetic progression \\((2b = a + c)\\), it didn't systematically check this condition for all tested \\(t\\) values. Each computed \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) should have been explicitly compared to verify the arithmetic progression, rather than relying on indirect reasoning.\n\n### 4. Inaccurate Conclusions\n\n- **Final \\(t\\) Value**: The concluding value \\( \\frac{5\\pi}{4} \\) was presented without proper justification or checking of whether that value indeed satisfied the AP condition. A calculated angle must lead to a set where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) clearly forms the arithmetic sequence; hence, the failure to check the specific conditions for that final value is a significant oversight.\n\n### 5. Notation and Clarity\n\n- **Notational Errors**: The notation for the outputs from the inverse functions could have been expressed in clearer terms. Specifically, clarity in how to define the output ranges of each function and what transformations applied should have been established first.\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\n\n1. **Logical Framework**: Establish a clear logical framework to explore values of \\(t\\). Start from basic properties of the functions, clearly outline ranges, and document how changes to \\(t\\) affect outputs.\n\n2. **Diverse Angle Selection**: Rather than testing a few angles, develop a systematic way to test combinations of angles that might yield results. Consider using angles that reflect symmetries in the unit circle as these might reveal interesting properties.\n\n3. **Explicit AP Verification**: Clearly compute and verify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) for each angle and explicitly state when they satisfy the arithmetic progression condition.\n\n4. **Final Validation**: For any candidate \\(t\\) values, validate by explicitly checking if they indeed lead to nonzero common differences while remaining within the stated function outputs.\n\n5. **Presentation**: Increase clarity in presentation. Use bullet points or a stepwise format when outlining the reasoning process to make it easier to follow.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the original solution lacked a structured approach to explore the problem, made calculations without clear checks against the requirements for arithmetic progressions, and failed to present a validated candidate for \\(t\\). Significant improvements can be made through rigorous systematic exploration of the problem, ensuring that all conditions are explicitly checked and verified, and presenting findings in a clearer manner. This structured approach will yield a more robust and correct solution.\n",

            "Let's carefully analyze the previous solution step by step and identify its flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. Misinterpretation and Lack of Structure\n\n- **Initial Setup**: The original answer did not clearly outline the method for how it approached finding suitable \\(t\\) values for forming an arithmetic progression. It jumped between various trials without a structured approach or explicit reasoning. A proper method should have been employed first to explicitly set the expectation of what constitutes an arithmetic progression.\n\n### 2. Incorrect Exploration of Values\n\n- **Angle Selection**: The examples given did not explore a comprehensive enough set of angles. The chosen angles like \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) do not sufficiently cover the periodic nature of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions and how they relate to their inverse functions. More strategic angles, including multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), or even angles that yield clearer differences, should have been emphasized.\n\n### 3. Output Analysis\n\n- **Arithmetic Progression Condition**: While it correctly mentioned the condition for an arithmetic progression \\((2b = a + c)\\), it didn't systematically check this condition for all tested \\(t\\) values. Each computed \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) should have been explicitly compared to verify the arithmetic progression, rather than relying on indirect reasoning.\n\n### 4. Inaccurate Conclusions\n\n- **Final \\(t\\) Value**: The concluding value \\( \\frac{5\\pi}{4} \\) was presented without proper justification or checking of whether that value indeed satisfied the AP condition. A calculated angle must lead to a set where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) clearly forms the arithmetic sequence; hence, the failure to check the specific conditions for that final value is a significant oversight.\n\n### 5. Notation and Clarity\n\n- **Notational Errors**: The notation for the outputs from the inverse functions could have been expressed in clearer terms. Specifically, clarity in how to define the output ranges of each function and what transformations applied should have been established first.\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\n\n1. **Logical Framework**: Establish a clear logical framework to explore values of \\(t\\). Start from basic properties of the functions, clearly outline ranges, and document how changes to \\(t\\) affect outputs.\n\n2. **Diverse Angle Selection**: Rather than testing a few angles, develop a systematic way to test combinations of angles that might yield results. Consider using angles that reflect symmetries in the unit circle as these might reveal interesting properties.\n\n3. **Explicit AP Verification**: Clearly compute and verify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) for each angle and explicitly state when they satisfy the arithmetic progression condition.\n\n4. **Final Validation**: For any candidate \\(t\\) values, validate by explicitly checking if they indeed lead to nonzero common differences while remaining within the stated function outputs.\n\n5. **Presentation**: Increase clarity in presentation. Use bullet points or a stepwise format when outlining the reasoning process to make it easier to follow.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the original solution lacked a structured approach to explore the problem, made calculations without clear checks against the requirements for arithmetic progressions, and failed to present a validated candidate for \\(t\\). Significant improvements can be made through rigorous systematic exploration of the problem, ensuring that all conditions are explicitly checked and verified, and presenting findings in a clearer manner. This structured approach will yield a more robust and correct solution.\n",

            "Certainly! Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step and evaluate its flaws:\n\n### Flaw 1: Incomplete Exploration of Values\nThe initial exploration of \\( t \\) values only examined specific angles: \\( 0 \\), \\( \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\), \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), and \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\).

The inputs could also satisfy \\( 2a = b + c \\) or \\( 2c = a + b \\).\n\n#### Suggested Improvement:\nList all permutations and check each condition of the arithmetic progression. Specifically, capturing all combinations and considering their ranges would lead to a thorough solution.\n\n### Flaw 3: No Consideration for Common Differences\nThe problem states that the common difference must be nonzero. It was implicitly assumed when finding values that the differences were nonzero without explicit verification.\n\n#### Suggested Improvement:\nExplicitly check that the common difference (even if it’s negative) is indeed non-zero after determining the values of \\( a, b, c \\).\n\n### Flaw 4: Lack of Clear Logical Deduction\nWhile the conclusion reached \\( t = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\), the reasoning could have been more concise, and clarifying why this is indeed the least positive value could improve the logic.\n\n#### Suggested Improvement:\nWrite out the process of narrowing down candidates for \\( t \\) and emphasize how you determined that \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\) is indeed the least value meeting the conditions.\n\n### A More Robust Approach\n\n1. **List All Functions**:\n    - Determine the effective outputs of \\( \\operatorname{Arcsin}, \\operatorname{Arccos}, \\operatorname{Arctan} \\) for general \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Enumerate Further**:\n    - Include considerations for additional trigonometric values, such as \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\), etc.\n\n3. **Check All Permutations**:\n    - Write down the arithmetic progression conditions explicitly for each combination, ensuring verification at each step.\n\n4. **Verify Nonzero Common Difference**:\n    - Ensure that the solutions not only progress arithmetically but also confirm that differences are non-zero.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy systematically addressing each point and ensuring a thorough check across all essential conditions, one can arrive at a more comprehensive solution that doesn't miss potential valid values of \\( t \\). \n\nIn summary, while the previous response reached a solution, the analysis showcases several oversights and areas for improvement, suggesting a more robust and thorough approach to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n### Suggested Correction Steps\n1.

                "Let's carefully analyze the previous solution step by step and identify its flaws and areas for improvement.\n\n### 1. Misinterpretation and Lack of Structure\n\n- **Initial Setup**: The original answer did not clearly outline the method for how it approached finding suitable \\(t\\) values for forming an arithmetic progression. It jumped between various trials without a structured approach or explicit reasoning. A proper method should have been employed first to explicitly set the expectation of what constitutes an arithmetic progression.\n\n### 2. Incorrect Exploration of Values\n\n- **Angle Selection**: The examples given did not explore a comprehensive enough set of angles. The chosen angles like \\(0\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\) do not sufficiently cover the periodic nature of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions and how they relate to their inverse functions. More strategic angles, including multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), or even angles that yield clearer differences, should have been emphasized.\n\n### 3. Output Analysis\n\n- **Arithmetic Progression Condition**: While it correctly mentioned the condition for an arithmetic progression \\((2b = a + c)\\), it didn't systematically check this condition for all tested \\(t\\) values. Each computed \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) should have been explicitly compared to verify the arithmetic progression, rather than relying on indirect reasoning.\n\n### 4. Inaccurate Conclusions\n\n- **Final \\(t\\) Value**: The concluding value \\( \\frac{5\\pi}{4} \\) was presented without proper justification or checking of whether that value indeed satisfied the AP condition. A calculated angle must lead to a set where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) clearly forms the arithmetic sequence; hence, the failure to check the specific conditions for that final value is a significant oversight.\n\n### 5. Notation and Clarity\n\n- **Notational Errors**: The notation for the outputs from the inverse functions could have been expressed in clearer terms. Specifically, clarity in how to define the output ranges of each function and what transformations applied should have been established first.\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\n\n1. **Logical Framework**: Establish a clear logical framework to explore values of \\(t\\). Start from basic properties of the functions, clearly outline ranges, and document how changes to \\(t\\) affect outputs.\n\n2. **Diverse Angle Selection**: Rather than testing a few angles, develop a systematic way to test combinations of angles that might yield results. Consider using angles that reflect symmetries in the unit circle as these might reveal interesting properties.\n\n3. **Explicit AP Verification**: Clearly compute and verify \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) for each angle and explicitly state when they satisfy the arithmetic progression condition.\n\n4. **Final Validation**: For any candidate \\(t\\) values, validate by explicitly checking if they indeed lead to nonzero common differences while remaining within the stated function outputs.\n\n5. **Presentation**: Increase clarity in presentation. Use bullet points or a stepwise format when outlining the reasoning process to make it easier to follow.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, the original solution lacked a structured approach to explore the problem, made calculations without clear checks against the requirements for arithmetic progressions, and failed to present a validated candidate for \\(t\\). Significant improvements can be made through rigorous systematic exploration of the problem, ensuring that all conditions are explicitly checked and verified, and presenting findings in a clearer manner. This structured approach will yield a more robust and correct solution.\n",
