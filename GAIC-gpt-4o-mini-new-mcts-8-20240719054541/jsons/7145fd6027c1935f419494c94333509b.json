        "Certainly! Let's analyze the answer step-by-step to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.\n\n### Evaluation Criteria\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure**\n2. **Mathematical Rigor**\n3. **Correctness of Conclusions**\n4. **Logical Flow**\n5. **Presentation of Answer**\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Answer\n\n#### 1. Clarity and Structure\n- **Strength**: The response begins with a logical progression, outlining the vectors and their representations clearly.\n- **Weakness**: The introduction can be more concise. For instance, stating the problem clearly at the beginning without reiteration would help.\n\n#### 2. Mathematical Rigor\n- **Strength**: The row reduction of the matrix to identify the dimension of the subspace is a valid and appropriate approach. The answer properly employs algebraic techniques and fundamental concepts of linear algebra.\n- **Weakness**: There is a lack of explicit explanation of the row reduction steps; this could confuse someone not familiar with the process. Additionally, there is an implicit assumption that all combinations of the two sets of vectors will yield the same subspace without demonstrating this exhaustively.\n\n#### 3. Correctness of Conclusions\n- **Strength**: The determination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is accurate, and the calculated values \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\) are indeed correct.\n- **Weakness**: However, the justification for how one arrives at these values could be clearer. The transitions for substitutions can be overwhelming and lack step-wise guidance for readers, particularly in deriving \\( y_1 \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n#### 4. Logical Flow\n- **Strength**: The logical flow is mostly coherent as it follows from defining the vectors to determining their relationships.\n- **Weakness**: There are points where the logical flow is somewhat interrupted, particularly when introducing and manipulating variables \\( x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 \\), it might confuse readers. Instead, defining the problem more clearly at each step would maintain clarity.\n  \n#### 5. Presentation of Answer\n- **Strength**: The notation \\( \\boxed{[1, 3]} \\) is clear and follows a good mathematical convention for presenting answers. \n- **Weakness**: The final presentation might include a brief summary that reiterates why \\( [1, 3] \\) is significant or explicitly state how the vectors span the same subspace.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n\n1. **Introduction**: Clearly state the problem upfront and define key vectors in a clear context.\n2. **Row Reduction Explanation**: Elaborate on the row-reduction steps, explaining the significance of each operation and how they relate to the original problem.\n3. **Step-by-Step Derivation**: For deriving \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), provide each algebraic manipulation step-by-step. Do not skip steps that could leave readers behind.\n4. **Clarify Relationships**: When establishing relationships between the vectors, explicitly show how to rearrange each variable and confirm every transformation.\n5. **Summary Statement**: Reinforce the conclusion by summarizing why the obtained values are indeed correct and how they meet the problem's criteria.\n\n### Final Remarks\n\nWhile the answer is fundamentally sound and reaches the correct conclusion, a more detailed and clear exposition would greatly enhance comprehension and clarity. Focused rigor in mathematical communication is essential for facilitating understanding and ensuring the audience can follow along with the logic presented.",

This way, we can build a more robust and clear approach to the problem.\n\n### Detailed Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Clarity of Vector Representation**:\n   - The introduction of the vectors is good, but it misses explicitly naming each vector clearly throughout the explanation. Each vector should be consistently referenced to prevent confusion.\n\n2. **Process of Row Reduction**:\n   - The row reduction was performed, but it could use additional explanation:\n     - Why we perform specific row operations and the significance of finding a row-reduced echelon form.\n     - Connecting the row-reduced form back to the span or basis—it should clearly explain how the resulting form indicates linear independence.\n\n3. **Establishing Linear Combinations**:\n   - The transition from expressing \\( w_1 \\) in terms of \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) was not thoroughly explained:\n     - More detail about what it means for vectors to span the same space would enhance understanding. It should emphasize the conditions under which two sets of vectors generate the same subspace.\n\n4. **Setting Up and Solving Equations**:\n   - The equations derived from setting the vector components equal are good, but the connection between them could be clearer:\n     - Each step to substitute and simplify the equations should be accompanied by a brief reasoning to clarify why that step was taken.\n     - The grouping of equations from both sets of vectors might confuse some readers. Making it distinctly separate for \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\) could help in maintaining clarity.\n\n5. **Final Conclusions and Verifications**:\n   - The verification part was somewhat lacking:\n     - It should ensure that the found values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are thoroughly checked against the original vectors by substituting back into the equations to see if they produce consistent results.\n     - It should also highlight that both vectors must ensure independence and cover the same span.\n\n6. **Formatting and Presenting the Answer**:\n   - While the final answer was presented, the formatting could be improved for clarity and professionalism:\n     - Include a concluding sentence summarizing the entire analysis before giving the final boxed answer.\n\n### Improved Answer\n\nTo enhance understanding and clarity, a revised answer might look like this:\n\n### Revised Answer\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the Given Vectors**:\n   - We have two sets of vectors:\n     - Set 1: \n       \\[\n       \\mathbf{v_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n       \\mathbf{v_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n       \\mathbf{v_3} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Set 2:\n       \\[\n       \\mathbf{w_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ a \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n       \\mathbf{w_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} b \\\\ 3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n       \\]\n\n2. **Find the Dimension of the Span from Set 1**:\n   - We shall form the matrix from these vectors:\n     \\[\n     A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n     1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n     1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n     1 & 0 & -1\n     \\end{pmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - We perform row operations to find the row echelon form:\n     - Subtract the first row from the second and third rows:\n     \\[\n     \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n     \\]\n     - Add the second row to the third:\n     \\[\n     \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - This indicates that the vectors span a 2-dimensional subspace.\n\n3. **Set Up Linear Combinations for Set 2**:\n   - Each vector in the second set must be expressible as a linear combination of vectors in the first set:\n   - For \\( \\mathbf{w_1} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{w_1} = x_1 \\mathbf{v_1} + x_2 \\mathbf{v_2}\n   \\]\n   - This yields the system:\n   \\[\n   0 = x_1 + x_2 \\quad (1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a = x_1 + 2 x_2 \\quad (2)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -1 = x_1 \\quad (3)\n   \\]\n   - From (3), substituting \\( x_1 = -1 \\):\n   \\[\n   0 = -1 + x_2 \\Rightarrow x_2 = 1\n   \\]\n   - Substitute into (2):\n   \\[\n   a = -1 + 2(1) = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expressing \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\)**:\n   - Now for \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{w_2} = y_1 \\mathbf{v_1} + y_2 \\mathbf{v_2}\n   \\]\n   - The equations become:\n   \\[\n   b + y_2 = 3 \\quad (4)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y_1 + 2y_2 = 1 \\quad (5)\n   \\]\n   - From (4), \\( y_2 = 3 - b \\).\n   - Substitute \\( y_2 \\) into (5):\n   \\[\n   y_1 + 2(3 - b) = 1 \\Rightarrow y_1 = 2b - 5\n   \\]\n   - Using \\( -1 = -y_1 + y_2 \\):\n   \\[\n   -1 = - (2b - 5) + (3 - b) \\Rightarrow -1 = -2b + 5 + 3 - b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -1 = 8 - 3b \\Rightarrow 3b = 9 \\Rightarrow b = 3\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter finding \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\), I will verify:\n- For \\( a \\):\n  - Substituting yields consistency.\n- For \\( b \\):\n  - Substituting confirms correctness.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{[1, 3]} \\n#### [1, 3]\\). \n\n### Overall Assessment\n- By maintaining clarity, logic, and structured reasoning, this revised answer provides a more comprehensive view while ensuring each step is supported with adequate detail.

        "Certainly! Here's a critical analysis of the previous answer, breaking down each part for clarity and accuracy.\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - The goal was to determine \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that two sets of vectors span the same subspace. The initial approach was correct in identifying the need for linear combinations, but it could have elaborated more clearly on how to systematically approach the problem.\n\n2. **Matrix Formation and Row Reduction**:\n   - The creation of the matrix \\( A \\) from the first set of vectors was correct. However, it could have included a brief explanation of why this step is necessary—namely, to analyze the span and dependencies of these vectors.\n   - The row reduction steps were correctly performed, but the intermediate steps could have been presented more clearly to avoid confusion, particularly in the explanation of how to interpret the reduced form.\n\n3. **Expressing \\( \\mathbf{w_1} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\)**:\n   - The method of expressing \\( \\mathbf{w_1} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\) as linear combinations of \\( \\mathbf{v_1}, \\mathbf{v_2}, \\mathbf{v_3} \\) was appropriate. However, the derivation of the equations should have been more explicitly linked back to the context of span and dependencies—specifically why we can find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) this way.\n   - The transitions between equations need to be clearer. Statements like \"Assume \\( \\mathbf{w_1} \\) can be expressed as...\" should ensure that it's clear that it's based on the dependence requirements for the span.\n\n4. **Calculating Values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)**:\n   - The calculations for \\( a \\) were correct, but the rationale behind each step should have been emphasized, particularly in the context of ensuring that the conditions are derived from the linear combination relationships.\n   - The calculations for \\( b \\) could have been better organized and should tie back to how \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\) needs to also be expressed as a linear combination of the original set vectors.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - The verification section was a positive aspect but could have been strengthened with more detailed explanations of what the verifications meant in terms of confirming the subspace correspondence. Proper boundary conditions or constraints for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) should follow from the initial definitions of linear independence/spanning.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - Throughout the solution, the answer could have been presented more systematically, perhaps with section headers (like \"Step 1\", \"Step 2\", \"Finalizing the Values\") to guide the reader. The answer formatting at the end was good, but it could have utilized an additional summary statement to reinforce how \\( [a, b] \\) represents the solution to the problem.\n\n### Key Corrections\n\n- **Contextual Clarity**: Needs more explanation on why linear combinations are constructed.\n- **Intermediate Steps**: Should show clearer transitions, ensuring logical flow.\n- **Verification**: Must connect back to original problem implications.\n- **Presentation**: Should use headings to segment thoughts and guide readers through the process logically.\n\n### Revised Approach Recommendations\n\n1. Start with a clear statement of the problem and outline the goal.\n2. Define the vectors more explicitly as belonging to specific sets and describe the linear dependencies.\n3. Clearly articulate each step in forming matrices and deriving equations.\n4. Organize calculations methodically while explicitly stating the purpose of each.\n5. Conclude with a strong verification that ties back to the original span requirement.\n\nThis structured feedback helps highlight not just errors but also enhances understanding and clarity for future submissions. The approach should be refined to ensure a detailed, well-organized response that thoroughly addresses the problem at hand."

For instance, stating the problem clearly at the beginning without reiteration would help.\n\n#### 2. Mathematical Rigor\n- **Strength**: The row reduction of the matrix to identify the dimension of the subspace is a valid and appropriate approach. The answer properly employs algebraic techniques and fundamental concepts of linear algebra.\n- **Weakness**: There is a lack of explicit explanation of the row reduction steps; this could confuse someone not familiar with the process.

            "Certainly! Here's a critical analysis of the previous answer, breaking down each part for clarity and accuracy.\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - The goal was to determine \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that two sets of vectors span the same subspace. The initial approach was correct in identifying the need for linear combinations, but it could have elaborated more clearly on how to systematically approach the problem.\n\n2. **Matrix Formation and Row Reduction**:\n   - The creation of the matrix \\( A \\) from the first set of vectors was correct. However, it could have included a brief explanation of why this step is necessary—namely, to analyze the span and dependencies of these vectors.\n   - The row reduction steps were correctly performed, but the intermediate steps could have been presented more clearly to avoid confusion, particularly in the explanation of how to interpret the reduced form.\n\n3. **Expressing \\( \\mathbf{w_1} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\)**:\n   - The method of expressing \\( \\mathbf{w_1} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\) as linear combinations of \\( \\mathbf{v_1}, \\mathbf{v_2}, \\mathbf{v_3} \\) was appropriate. However, the derivation of the equations should have been more explicitly linked back to the context of span and dependencies—specifically why we can find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) this way.\n   - The transitions between equations need to be clearer. Statements like \"Assume \\( \\mathbf{w_1} \\) can be expressed as...\" should ensure that it's clear that it's based on the dependence requirements for the span.\n\n4. **Calculating Values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)**:\n   - The calculations for \\( a \\) were correct, but the rationale behind each step should have been emphasized, particularly in the context of ensuring that the conditions are derived from the linear combination relationships.\n   - The calculations for \\( b \\) could have been better organized and should tie back to how \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\) needs to also be expressed as a linear combination of the original set vectors.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - The verification section was a positive aspect but could have been strengthened with more detailed explanations of what the verifications meant in terms of confirming the subspace correspondence. Proper boundary conditions or constraints for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) should follow from the initial definitions of linear independence/spanning.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - Throughout the solution, the answer could have been presented more systematically, perhaps with section headers (like \"Step 1\", \"Step 2\", \"Finalizing the Values\") to guide the reader. The answer formatting at the end was good, but it could have utilized an additional summary statement to reinforce how \\( [a, b] \\) represents the solution to the problem.\n\n### Key Corrections\n\n- **Contextual Clarity**: Needs more explanation on why linear combinations are constructed.\n- **Intermediate Steps**: Should show clearer transitions, ensuring logical flow.\n- **Verification**: Must connect back to original problem implications.\n- **Presentation**: Should use headings to segment thoughts and guide readers through the process logically.\n\n### Revised Approach Recommendations\n\n1. Start with a clear statement of the problem and outline the goal.\n2. Define the vectors more explicitly as belonging to specific sets and describe the linear dependencies.\n3. Clearly articulate each step in forming matrices and deriving equations.\n4. Organize calculations methodically while explicitly stating the purpose of each.\n5. Conclude with a strong verification that ties back to the original span requirement.\n\nThis structured feedback helps highlight not just errors but also enhances understanding and clarity for future submissions. The approach should be refined to ensure a detailed, well-organized response that thoroughly addresses the problem at hand."

Subtract the first row from the second and third rows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -1 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n2. Now, add the second row to the third row:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe reduced row echelon form indicates that the rank of this matrix is 2. Thus, the dimension of the subspace spanned by \\( \\mathbf{v_1}, \\mathbf{v_2}, \\mathbf{v_3} \\) is 2.\n\nNext, we will form a matrix with the vectors \\( \\mathbf{u_1} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{u_2} \\):\n\n\\[\nB = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & b \\\\\na & 3 \\\\\n-1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nPerform row reduction on \\( B \\):\n\n1. Swap the first row and the second row (to avoid leading zero):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & 3 \\\\\n0 & b \\\\\n-1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n2. To eliminate the entry in the first column of the third row, do the following operation: \\( R_3 \\leftarrow R_3 + (1/a)R_1 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na & 3 \\\\\n0 & b \\\\\n0 & (3 - 1/a)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor the space generated by the matrices to be the same, the rank of \\( B \\) must also equal 2. Thus, \\( a \\) must not be zero, and both \\( b \\) and \\( 3 - 1/a \\) must not equal zero, which gives conditions we can solve:\n\nFrom \\( 3 - (1/a) \\neq 0 \\), rearranging gives:\n\n\\[\n3a - 1 \\neq 0 \\implies 3a \\neq 1 \\implies a \\neq \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, we also have:\n\n1. For \\( b \\) to be non-zero (to maintain full rank), we need \\( b \\neq 0 \\).\n\nNow, to find values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), we note that to generate the same subspace, they should express the same relationships. Since we have \\( \\mathbf{u_1} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v_1} \\) must relate, we can solve directly by setting \n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ a \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} b \\\\ 3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nfor suitable scalars \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\).

Clarity and Structure\n- **Strength**: The response begins with a logical progression, outlining the vectors and their representations clearly.\n- **Weakness**: The introduction can be more concise. For instance, stating the problem clearly at the beginning without reiteration would help.\n\n#### 2. Mathematical Rigor\n- **Strength**: The row reduction of the matrix to identify the dimension of the subspace is a valid and appropriate approach. The answer properly employs algebraic techniques and fundamental concepts of linear algebra.\n- **Weakness**: There is a lack of explicit explanation of the row reduction steps; this could confuse someone not familiar with the process. Additionally, there is an implicit assumption that all combinations of the two sets of vectors will yield the same subspace without demonstrating this exhaustively.\n\n#### 3. Correctness of Conclusions\n- **Strength**: The determination of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is accurate, and the calculated values \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\) are indeed correct.\n- **Weakness**: However, the justification for how one arrives at these values could be clearer. The transitions for substitutions can be overwhelming and lack step-wise guidance for readers, particularly in deriving \\( y_1 \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n#### 4.

Now, add the second row to the third row:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe reduced row echelon form indicates that the rank of this matrix is 2. Thus, the dimension of the subspace spanned by \\( \\mathbf{v_1}, \\mathbf{v_2}, \\mathbf{v_3} \\) is 2.\n\nNext, we will form a matrix with the vectors \\( \\mathbf{u_1} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{u_2} \\):\n\n\\[\nB = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & b \\\\\na & 3 \\\\\n-1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nPerform row reduction on \\( B \\):\n\n1.

We can do this by ensuring that the vectors in Set 2 can be expressed as linear combinations of those in Set 1.\n\n#### Step 1: Form the Matrix from Set 1\n\nFirst, we form a matrix \\( A \\) using the vectors from Set 1:\n\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNext, we perform row reduction to determine the dimension of the span of these vectors.\n\n1.

            "Certainly! Here's a critical analysis of the previous answer, breaking down each part for clarity and accuracy.\n\n### Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - The goal was to determine \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that two sets of vectors span the same subspace. The initial approach was correct in identifying the need for linear combinations, but it could have elaborated more clearly on how to systematically approach the problem.\n\n2. **Matrix Formation and Row Reduction**:\n   - The creation of the matrix \\( A \\) from the first set of vectors was correct. However, it could have included a brief explanation of why this step is necessary—namely, to analyze the span and dependencies of these vectors.\n   - The row reduction steps were correctly performed, but the intermediate steps could have been presented more clearly to avoid confusion, particularly in the explanation of how to interpret the reduced form.\n\n3. **Expressing \\( \\mathbf{w_1} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\)**:\n   - The method of expressing \\( \\mathbf{w_1} \\) and \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\) as linear combinations of \\( \\mathbf{v_1}, \\mathbf{v_2}, \\mathbf{v_3} \\) was appropriate. However, the derivation of the equations should have been more explicitly linked back to the context of span and dependencies—specifically why we can find \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) this way.\n   - The transitions between equations need to be clearer. Statements like \"Assume \\( \\mathbf{w_1} \\) can be expressed as...\" should ensure that it's clear that it's based on the dependence requirements for the span.\n\n4. **Calculating Values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)**:\n   - The calculations for \\( a \\) were correct, but the rationale behind each step should have been emphasized, particularly in the context of ensuring that the conditions are derived from the linear combination relationships.\n   - The calculations for \\( b \\) could have been better organized and should tie back to how \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\) needs to also be expressed as a linear combination of the original set vectors.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - The verification section was a positive aspect but could have been strengthened with more detailed explanations of what the verifications meant in terms of confirming the subspace correspondence. Proper boundary conditions or constraints for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) should follow from the initial definitions of linear independence/spanning.\n\n6. **Final Presentation**:\n   - Throughout the solution, the answer could have been presented more systematically, perhaps with section headers (like \"Step 1\", \"Step 2\", \"Finalizing the Values\") to guide the reader. The answer formatting at the end was good, but it could have utilized an additional summary statement to reinforce how \\( [a, b] \\) represents the solution to the problem.\n\n### Key Corrections\n\n- **Contextual Clarity**: Needs more explanation on why linear combinations are constructed.\n- **Intermediate Steps**: Should show clearer transitions, ensuring logical flow.\n- **Verification**: Must connect back to original problem implications.\n- **Presentation**: Should use headings to segment thoughts and guide readers through the process logically.\n\n### Revised Approach Recommendations\n\n1. Start with a clear statement of the problem and outline the goal.\n2. Define the vectors more explicitly as belonging to specific sets and describe the linear dependencies.\n3. Clearly articulate each step in forming matrices and deriving equations.\n4. Organize calculations methodically while explicitly stating the purpose of each.\n5. Conclude with a strong verification that ties back to the original span requirement.\n\nThis structured feedback helps highlight not just errors but also enhances understanding and clarity for future submissions. The approach should be refined to ensure a detailed, well-organized response that thoroughly addresses the problem at hand.",

This way, we can build a more robust and clear approach to the problem.\n\n### Detailed Analysis of the Previous Answer\n\n1. **Clarity of Vector Representation**:\n   - The introduction of the vectors is good, but it misses explicitly naming each vector clearly throughout the explanation. Each vector should be consistently referenced to prevent confusion.\n\n2. **Process of Row Reduction**:\n   - The row reduction was performed, but it could use additional explanation:\n     - Why we perform specific row operations and the significance of finding a row-reduced echelon form.\n     - Connecting the row-reduced form back to the span or basis—it should clearly explain how the resulting form indicates linear independence.\n\n3. **Establishing Linear Combinations**:\n   - The transition from expressing \\( w_1 \\) in terms of \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\) was not thoroughly explained:\n     - More detail about what it means for vectors to span the same space would enhance understanding. It should emphasize the conditions under which two sets of vectors generate the same subspace.\n\n4. **Setting Up and Solving Equations**:\n   - The equations derived from setting the vector components equal are good, but the connection between them could be clearer:\n     - Each step to substitute and simplify the equations should be accompanied by a brief reasoning to clarify why that step was taken.\n     - The grouping of equations from both sets of vectors might confuse some readers. Making it distinctly separate for \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\) could help in maintaining clarity.\n\n5. **Final Conclusions and Verifications**:\n   - The verification part was somewhat lacking:\n     - It should ensure that the found values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are thoroughly checked against the original vectors by substituting back into the equations to see if they produce consistent results.\n     - It should also highlight that both vectors must ensure independence and cover the same span.\n\n6. **Formatting and Presenting the Answer**:\n   - While the final answer was presented, the formatting could be improved for clarity and professionalism:\n     - Include a concluding sentence summarizing the entire analysis before giving the final boxed answer.\n\n### Improved Answer\n\nTo enhance understanding and clarity, a revised answer might look like this:\n\n### Revised Answer\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the Given Vectors**:\n   - We have two sets of vectors:\n     - Set 1: \n       \\[\n       \\mathbf{v_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n       \\mathbf{v_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n       \\mathbf{v_3} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n       \\]\n     - Set 2:\n       \\[\n       \\mathbf{w_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ a \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n       \\mathbf{w_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} b \\\\ 3 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n       \\]\n\n2. **Find the Dimension of the Span from Set 1**:\n   - We shall form the matrix from these vectors:\n     \\[\n     A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n     1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n     1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n     1 & 0 & -1\n     \\end{pmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - We perform row operations to find the row echelon form:\n     - Subtract the first row from the second and third rows:\n     \\[\n     \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n     \\]\n     - Add the second row to the third:\n     \\[\n     \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - This indicates that the vectors span a 2-dimensional subspace.\n\n3. **Set Up Linear Combinations for Set 2**:\n   - Each vector in the second set must be expressible as a linear combination of vectors in the first set:\n   - For \\( \\mathbf{w_1} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{w_1} = x_1 \\mathbf{v_1} + x_2 \\mathbf{v_2}\n   \\]\n   - This yields the system:\n   \\[\n   0 = x_1 + x_2 \\quad (1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a = x_1 + 2 x_2 \\quad (2)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -1 = x_1 \\quad (3)\n   \\]\n   - From (3), substituting \\( x_1 = -1 \\):\n   \\[\n   0 = -1 + x_2 \\Rightarrow x_2 = 1\n   \\]\n   - Substitute into (2):\n   \\[\n   a = -1 + 2(1) = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expressing \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\)**:\n   - Now for \\( \\mathbf{w_2} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{w_2} = y_1 \\mathbf{v_1} + y_2 \\mathbf{v_2}\n   \\]\n   - The equations become:\n   \\[\n   b + y_2 = 3 \\quad (4)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y_1 + 2y_2 = 1 \\quad (5)\n   \\]\n   - From (4), \\( y_2 = 3 - b \\).\n   - Substitute \\( y_2 \\) into (5):\n   \\[\n   y_1 + 2(3 - b) = 1 \\Rightarrow y_1 = 2b - 5\n   \\]\n   - Using \\( -1 = -y_1 + y_2 \\):\n   \\[\n   -1 = - (2b - 5) + (3 - b) \\Rightarrow -1 = -2b + 5 + 3 - b\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -1 = 8 - 3b \\Rightarrow 3b = 9 \\Rightarrow b = 3\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter finding \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\), I will verify:\n- For \\( a \\):\n  - Substituting yields consistency.\n- For \\( b \\):\n  - Substituting confirms correctness.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{[1, 3]} \\n#### [1, 3]\\). \n\n### Overall Assessment\n- By maintaining clarity, logic, and structured reasoning, this revised answer provides a more comprehensive view while ensuring each step is supported with adequate detail.
